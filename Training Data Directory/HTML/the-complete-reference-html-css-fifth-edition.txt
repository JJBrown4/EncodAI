About the Technical Editor

James H. (Jim) Pence is a full-time writer, editor, speaker,
singer, and performance chalk artist. Jim broke into book
publishing in 2001 with How to Do Everything with HTML,
a how-to book on Web authoring, written “by a nontechie for
nontechies,” and published by McGraw-Hill Professional. He
followed this book the same year with another book for
McGraw-Hill: Cascading Style Sheets: A Beginner’s Guide.
McGraw-Hill published a second edition of Jim’s HTML
book, re-titled How to Do Everything with HTML & XHTML,
in 2003.
Jim is also a published novelist. He is the author of Blind
Sight (Tyndale, 2003), a suspense/thriller novel set in the
mind-control cults, and The Angel (Kregel, 2006), set against
the backdrop of the euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide
movements. Jim moved into “true crime” writing with his
latest book, Terror by Night (Tyndale, 2009). Terror by Night is
the true story of the brutal 2008 murders of the Caffey family
in Emory, Texas. You can learn more about Jim’s books and

he fifth edition of this book might as well be the first edition of a brand-new book.
The HTML5 specification marks a return to past ideas and an explosion of future
ideas. It took a great deal of work to put this new edition together. Given the amount
of effort required, I want to make sure that all those that helped are given their due. First, I
want to acknowledge the numerous fixes and improvements that came from the feedback
from both my students at UCSD and readers around the world. I write these books for you,
and I am glad you are putting this information to good use.
I would also like to show my appreciation to the many staff members at PINT who
helped on this book project in some direct or indirect way. I can’t specifically thank and
mention the dozens of employees we have at PINT and my other firm Port80 Software who
keep the lights on, but I’ll call a few out who warrant some extra kudos.
Christie Sorenson once again helped this time with heavy lifting particularly in the CSS
effort, and I can safely say that she has learned, relearned, and even forgotten more about
Web development than probably anyone I know, besides maybe myself. Looking forward to
more project fun in the future, Christie!
Plenty of other PINTsters helped. Rob McFarlane, Andrew Simpkins, and Bryan Sleiter
helped out with imagery. The project managers, particularly Mine Okano, Robin Nobel,
Matt Plotner, and Olivia Chen, gave me moral support and occasional pity as I toiled away
upstairs. Glenn Dawson addressed my many server changes and helped debug some
annoying aspects of HTML5. Dan Whitworth assisted on a few chapters here and there and
probably had nightmares about getting a call to really dive in.
Joe Lima listened to some of my verbal nonsense and helped guide me to some deeper
insights than I could have ever arrived at on my own.
Daisy Bhonsle kept up a very long-standing proofing relationship, and I am very glad
she always helps out. The student certainly has become the master.
The folks at McGraw-Hill Professional are always a pleasure to work with. Meghan
Riley helped guide me along, and Megg Morin didn’t lose faith, at least not completely.
Thanks for being my patron the last decade, Megg!
My technical editor, James Pence, probably wondered when this project was going to
finish, and somehow he finished a nontechnical book of his own during the project.

HTML & CSS: The Complete Reference

Finally, to my friends and family who tried to give me space to write this thing, you
deserve the biggest thanks. My children, Graham, Olivia, and Desmond, had to put up
with a grouchy dad and far too many absent weekends, so we now return you to our
regularly scheduled weekends! Cecilia, you provided a lot of help as well that made
things a bit easier on all of us, so thank you for that. Finally, Sylvia, you always support
my online efforts, as hard as they may be. I know you, more than anyone, appreciate the
importance of this project, considering the role HTML has played in our lives.

Introduction

Introduction

T

he fifth edition of this book represents a significant change in structure and content to
address HTML5. The book is similar to the previous edition in maybe a third of the
content; otherwise, it is an all-new effort. Most obviously, as compared to the previous
editions, which focused mainly on XHTML and HTML 4, this edition focuses on HTML5,
which represents both a return to the markup past and the unveiling of an exciting future of
Web applications. However, we do retain some information from previous editions because
in order for this work to be truly complete, we must not focus only on the future but also
present all the elements supported in browsers today, including the archaic, proprietary, and
standard (X)HTML tags. These will still be encountered for years to come, and we want this
book to provide the reference you need in addressing their syntax.
CSS coverage has been expanded greatly to fully cover CSS 2.1 as well as every proprietary
and emerging CSS 3 property supported in one or more popular shipping browsers circa 2009.
No value judgment is made; if Internet Explorer has supported a proprietary CSS feature for
the last decade, it’s included. However, we do avoid presenting CSS features that are truly
speculative in great depth, but where appropriate, we summarize or present pointers to the
emerging syntax.
The ramification of the increased markup and CSS coverage is simply the book doesn’t
have space left to do everything it did before. Teaching nearly everything about HTML and
CSS in prose form and then presenting a complete syntax reference for the technologies
would have produced a book well over 2,000 pages. We were well on the way to that when
we adjusted our efforts to create what you have in your hands, a solid reference book that
may be used for years to come. This isn’t to say that learning material is not present at all.
There are very solid introductory chapters for the markup and CSS sections, which should
succinctly address details and standards issues. There just isn’t a step-by-step cookbook for
each element or property. Given the maturity of the Web industry, we aimed not for the
complete tutorial, but instead for the complete reference.
It should go without saying that more markup changes to HTML and CSS are inevitable.
HTML5, in particular, is a complete moving target, and rather than punting on it, we took
the best shot at its first release version as it settled in late 2009. Because of the inevitable
changes given HTML5’s rapid evolution, the support Web site, http://htmlref.com, should
be considered an important bookmark for readers looking for updates or the unavoidable
correction.

CHAPTER

Traditional HTML and XHTML

M

arkup languages are ubiquitous in everyday computing. Although you may not
realize it, word processing documents are filled with markup directives indicating
the structure and often presentation of the document. In the case of traditional
word processing documents, these structural and presentational markup codes are more
often than not behind the scenes. However, in the case of Web documents, markup in the form
of traditional Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and its Extensible Markup Language
(XML)-focused variant, XHTML, is a little more obvious. These not-so-behind-the-scenes
markup languages are used to inform Web browsers about page structure and, some might
argue, presentation as well.

First Look at HTML and XHTML
In the case of HTML, markup instructions found within a Web page relay the structure of
the document to the browser software. For example, if you want to emphasize a portion of
text, you enclose it within the tags <em> and </em>, as shown here:
<em>This is important text!</em>

Part I:

Core Markup

When a Web browser reads a document that has HTML markup in it, it determines how
to render it onscreen by considering the HTML elements embedded within the document:

So, an HTML document is simply a text file that contains the information you want to
publish and the appropriate markup instructions indicating how the browser should
structure or present the document.
Markup elements are made up of a start tag, such as <strong>, and typically, though not
always, an end tag, which is indicated by a slash within the tag, such as </strong>. The tag
pair should fully enclose any content to be affected by the element, including text and other
HTML markup.

NOTE There is a distinction between an element (for example, strong) and the tags (<strong>

and </strong>) that are used by the element. However, you will likely often find the word
“tag” used in place of “element” in many if not most discussions about HTML markup. This
observation even includes historically relevant documents discussing HTML1 written by Tim
Berners-Lee, the founding father of the Web. Fortunately, despite any imprecision of word choice
that people may exhibit when discussing markup, meaning is usually well understood and this
should not be a tremendous concern.

Under traditional HTML (not XHTML), the close tag for some elements is optional
because their closure can be inferred. For example, a <p> tag cannot enclose another <p>
tag, and thus the closing </p> tag can be inferred when markup like this is encountered:
<p>This is a paragraph.
<p>This is also a paragraph.

Such shortened notations that depend on inference may be technically correct under the
specification, but stylistically they are not encouraged. It is always preferable to be precise,
so use markup like this instead:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is also a paragraph.</p>

Chapter 1:

Tr a d i t i o n a l H T M L a n d X H T M L

<br>

However, in XML markup variants, particularly XHTML, an unclosed tag is not allowed, so
you need to close the tag
<br></br>

or, more commonly, use a self-identification of closure like so:
<br />

The start tag of an element might contain attributes that modify the meaning of the tag.
For example, in HTML, the simple inclusion of the noshade attribute in an <hr> tag, as
shown here:
<hr noshade>

indicates that there should be no shading applied to this horizontal rule. Under XHTML,
such style attributes are not allowed, because all attributes must have a value, so instead
you have to use syntax like this:
<hr noshade="noshade" />

As the preceding example shows, attributes may require values, which are specified with an
equal sign; these values should be enclosed within double or single quotes. For example,
using standard HTML syntax,
<img src="dog.gif" alt="Angus-Black Scottish Terrier" height="100"
width="100">

specifies four attributes for this <img> tag that are used to provide more information about
the use of the included image. Under traditional HTML, in the case of simple alphanumeric
attribute values, the use of quotes is optional, as shown here:
<p class=fancy>

Regardless of the flexibility provided under standard HTML, you should always aim to
use quotes on all attributes. You will find that doing so makes markup more consistent,
makes upgrading to stricter markup versions far easier, and tends to help reduce errors
caused by inconsistency.

PART I

There are markup elements, called empty elements, which do not enclose any content, thus
need no close tags at all, or in the case of XHTML use a self-close identification scheme. For
example, to insert a line break, use a single <br> tag, which represents the empty br element,
because it doesn’t enclose any content and thus has no corresponding close tag:

Hello HTML and XHTML World
Given these basics of HTML syntax, it is best now to look at an example document to see its
application. Our first complete example written in strict HTML 4 is shown here:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Hello HTML 4 World</title>
<!-- Simple hello world in HTML 4.01 strict example -->
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to the World of HTML</h1>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch1/html4helloworld.html
A simple modification of the initial <!DOCTYPE> line is really all that is necessary to
make this an HTML5 example, the comment and text is changed so you can keep the
examples straight:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Hello HTML5 World</title>
<!-- Simple hello world in HTML5 example -->

<h1>Welcome to the Future World of HTML5</h1>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch1/html5helloworld.html
In the case of XHTML, which is a form of HTML that is based upon the syntax rules of
XML, we really don’t see many major changes yet in our example:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
<title>Hello XHTML World</title>
<!-- Simple hello world in XHTML 1.0 strict example -->
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to the World of XHTML</h1>
<hr />
<p>XHTML <em>really</em> isn't so hard either!</p>
<p>Soon you will &hearts; using XHTML too.</p>
<p>There are some differences between XHTML
and HTML but with some precise markup you'll
see such differences are easily addressed.</p>
</body>
</html>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch1/xhtmlhelloworld.html
The preceding examples use some of the most common elements used in (X)HTML
documents, including:
• The <!DOCTYPE> statement, which indicates the particular version of HTML
or XHTML being used in the document. The first example uses the strict 4.01
specification, the second uses a reduced form for HTML5 the meaning of which
will be explained a bit later on, and the final example uses the XHTML 1.0 strict
specification.
• The <html>, <head>, and <body> tag pairs are used to specify the general structure
of the document. The required inclusion of the xmlns attribute in the <html> tag is
a small difference required by XHTML.
• The <meta> tag used in the examples indicates the MIME type of the document and
the character set in use. Notice that in the XHTML example, the element has a trailing
slash to indicate that it is an empty element.
• The <title> and </title> tag pair specifies the title of the document, which
generally appears in the title bar of the Web browser.
• A comment is specified by <!-future reference.

Part I:

Core Markup

• The <h1> and </h1> header tag pair indicates a headline specifying some important
information.
• The <hr> tag, which has a self-identifying end tag (<hr />) under XHTML, inserts
a horizontal rule, or bar, across the screen.
• The <p> and </p> paragraph tag pair indicates a paragraph of text.
• A special character is inserted using a named entity (&hearts;), which in this case
inserts a heart dingbat character into the text.
• The <em> and </em> tag pair surrounds a small piece of text to emphasize which a
browser typically renders in italics.
There are numerous other markup elements that may be employed, all of which will be
explored throughout the book, but for now this sampling is enough to get our first example
rendered in a browser.

NOTE Examples in the book will generally be presented in HTML5. Syntax specific to particular
browsers, older HTML variants, or XHTML will always be noted when used.

Viewing Markup Locally
Using a simple text editor, type in either one of the previous examples and save it with a
filename such as helloworld.html or helloworld.htm; you can choose which file extension to
use, .htm or .html, but whichever you pick for development, aim to be consistent. This
book uses .html for all of the files.
After you save the example file on your local file system, open it in your Web browser
by opening the File menu and choosing Open, Open Page, or Open File, depending on your
browser:

Chapter 1:

Once your browser reads the file, it should render a page like the one shown here:

PART I

If for some reason you didn’t save your file with the appropriate extension, the browser
shouldn’t attempt to interpret the HTML markup. For example, notice here what happens
when you try to open the content with a .txt extension:

If you want to make a change to the document, you could update the markup, save the
file, go back to the browser, and click the Reload or Refresh button. Sometimes the browser
will still reload the page from its cache; if a page does not update correctly on reload, hold
down the SHIFT key while clicking the Reload button, and the browser should refresh the page.
As you write markup, keeping the browser and editor open simultaneously is a very
good idea to avoid constantly reopening one or the other. Many Web editors will assist you
in loading your Web pages into various browsers or even preview the visualization of the
markup directly. Figure 1-1 shows this process in Adobe’s popular Dreamweaver program
(www. dreamweaver.com).

Improved markup editing in Dreamweaver

Once you get the hang of markup production, you’ll see that, at this raw level, it is
much like the edit, compile, and run cycle so familiar to programmers. However, this
manual process certainly isn’t the way that you want to develop Web pages, because it can
be tedious, error prone, and inefficient when thinking of page structure and visual design.
For our current illustrative purposes to learn the language however, it works fine.

Viewing Markup with a Web Server
Ideally, you should aim to test your Web pages as delivered off a Web server instead of just
reading them off a local file system. Not only is this more representative of how your users
will actually experience the page, but it prepares you for later construction of Web pages
that contain server-side programming technologies.
There are many options for employing a Web server. You may decide to run your own
local development Web server on your desktop system or use some hosted server instead.
In either case, you need to get the files somewhere under the Web server’s document root
folder so that they can be served out. Very often this directory has a common name like
inetpub, htdocs, site, or www, but it really could be just about anything, so make sure you
check the server you end up using.

Chapter 1:

Tr a d i t i o n a l H T M L a n d X H T M L

Many Web editors also allow you to synchronize files between a local directory and
your remote server. For example, a snippet of the synchronization facility provided in
Dreamweaver is shown here:

PART I

To make your files available via the server, you might use a process of uploading a
file from your system to a remote server via an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program, as
shown here:

11

12

Part I:

Core Markup

On the Web server, you most likely will use the .html or .htm file extension for your
files. When HTML files are placed in the appropriate directory, the user would issue a URL
in their browser like
http://yoursitename/sitepath/helloworld.html

and that will then return the file in question. However, note that when a marked-up
document is delivered over the network, it is not the file extension that indicates to the
browser that the content is HTML, but rather the Content-Type: header found in the
network stream:

Chapter 1:

Tr a d i t i o n a l H T M L a n d X H T M L

This Preferences dialog box shows that the extension or header is what triggers the action
by the browser. The goal here is simply to illustrate that there is something different going
on between reading locally and remotely.
Before wrapping up this brief introductory example, it should be noted that in some
cases when you have configured the wrong file extension or MIME type, some browsers may
“sniff out” the content type and parse any HTML found within. For example, in Figure 1-2
you can see that many versions of Internet Explorer2 render a file with a .txt extension as
HTML while Firefox does not. We have to pay attention to details even in the simplest
examples if we want to avoid headaches from questionable browser practices and plain old
bugs. HTML5 will aim to remove such problems in the distant future, but for now let’s get
down to the most important details, starting first by enumerating all of the versions of
(X)HTML that we might need to know about.

2

Internet Explorer 8 introduces some changes to avoid sniffing; you can set X-Content-Type-Options:
nosniff as a response header to disable Internet Explorer’s permissive behavior, though this only works
in IE8 and beyond.

PART I

The browser then takes the header and maps it to the action of parsing the document as
HTML. In some older browsers, the mapping between MIME type or file extension and
browser action is obvious:

code in the page, and renders as if it were an html file.

Firefox recognizes the file type and renders the
text rather than interpret the code as html.

HTML and XHTML: Version History
Since its initial introduction in late 1991, HTML (and later its XML-based cousin, XHTML)
has undergone many changes. Interestingly, the first versions of HTML used to build the
earliest Web pages lacked a rigorous definition. Fortunately, by 1993 the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) began to standardize the language and later, in 1995, released the first real
HTML standard in the form of HTML 2.0. You will likely encounter more than just the latest
style of markup for many years to come, so Table 1-1 presents a brief summary of the version
history of HTML and XHTML.

Chapter 1:

HTML or XHTML Version

Description

HTML 2.0

Classic HTML dialect supported by browsers such as Mosaic. This
form of HTML supports core HTML elements and features such as
tables and forms, but does not consider any of the browser innovations
of advanced features such as style sheets, scripting, or frames.

HTML 3.0

The proposed replacement for HTML 2.0 that was never widely
adopted, most likely due to the heavy use of browser-specific markup.

HTML 3.2

An HTML finalized by the W3C in early 1997 that standardized most of
the HTML features introduced in browsers such as Netscape 3. This
version of HTML supports many presentation-focused elements such
as font, as well as early support for some scripting features.

HTML 4.0 Transitional

The 4.0 transitional form finalized by the W3C in December of 1997
preserves most of the presentational elements of HTML 3.2. It
provides a basis of transition to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as
well as a base set of elements and attributes for multiple-language
support, accessibility, and scripting.

HTML 4.0 Strict

The strict version of HTML 4.0 removes most of the presentation
elements from the HTML specification, such as font, in favor of using
CSS for page formatting.

4.0 Frameset

The frameset specification provides a rigorous syntax for framed
documents that was lacking in previous versions of HTML.

HTML 4.01 Transitional/
Strict/Frameset

A minor update to the 4.0 standard that corrects some of the errors in
the original specification.

HTML5

Addressing the lack of acceptance of the XML reformulation of HTML
by the mass of Web page authors, the emerging HTML5 standard
originally started by the WHATWG3 group and later rolled into a W3C
effort aimed to rekindle the acceptance of traditional HTML and
extend it to address Web application development, multimedia, and
the ambiguities found in browser parsers. Since 2005, features now
part of this HTML specification have begun to appear in Web browsers,
muddying the future of XHTML in Web browsers.

XHTML 1.0 Transitional

A reformulation of HTML as an XML application. The transitional
form preserves many of the basic presentation features of HTML 4.0
transitional but applies the strict syntax rules of XML to HTML.

XHTML 1.0 Strict

A reformulation of HTML 4.0 Strict using XML. This language is rule
enforcing and leaves all presentation duties to technologies like CSS.

XHTML 1.1

A restructuring of XHTML 1.0 that modularizes the language for easy
extension and reduction. It is not commonly used at the time of this
writing and offers minor gains over strict XHTML 1.0.

XHTML 2.0

A new implementation of XHTML that will not provide backward
compatibility with XHTML 1.0 and traditional HTML. XHTML 2 will
remove all presentational tags and will introduce a variety of new
tags and ideas to the language.

XHTML Basic 1.0

A variation of XHTML based upon the modularization of XHTML (1.1)
designed to work with less-power ful Web clients such as mobile
phones.

XHTML Basic 1.1

An improvement to the XHTML Basic specification that adds more
features, some fairly specific to the constrained interfaces found in
mobile devices.

TABLE 1-1

Description of Common HTML Versions (continued)

Beyond the standard forms of markup described in Table 1-1, there are of course various
nonstandard forms in play. For example, the browser vendors introduced various extensions
to HTML and, interestingly, continue to do so. We also have to contend with the ad hoc use
of markup that doesn’t really conform fully to any particular standard other than to what
usually renders in common Web browsers. Such a “tag soup” is certainly not the best way
to approach building Web pages, regardless of whether browsers accept it. Standards for all
forms of markup exist and should be adhered to whenever possible.

HTML and XHTML DTDs: The Specifications Up Close
Contrary to the markup some Web developers seem to produce, both HTML and XHTML
have very well-defined syntax. All (X)HTML documents should follow a formal structure
defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C; www.w3.org), which is the primary
organization that defines Web standards. Traditionally, the W3C defined HTML as an
application of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). SGML is a technology
used to define markup languages by specifying the allowed document structure in the form
of a document type definition (DTD). A DTD indicates the syntax that can be used for the
various elements of a language such as HTML.
A snippet of the HTML 4.01 DTD defining the P element, which indicates a paragraph,
is shown here:
<!--=================== Paragraphs =====================================-->
<!ELEMENT P - O (%inline;)*
-- paragraph -->
<!ATTLIST P
%attrs;
-- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events ->

The first line is a comment indicating what is below it. The second line defines the P
element, indicating that it has a start tag (<P>), as shown by the dash, and an optional close
tag (</P>), as indicated by the O. The type of content that is allowed to be placed within a
P element is defined by the entity %inline, which acts here as a shorthand for various other
elements and content. This idea of only allowing some types of elements within other

Chapter 1:

Tr a d i t i o n a l H T M L a n d X H T M L

<!--=================== Horizontal Rule ================================-->
<!ELEMENT HR - O EMPTY -- horizontal rule -->
<!ATTLIST HR
%attrs;
-- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events ->

From this syntax fragment, note that the HR element has a start tag but does not require a
close tag. More interestingly, the element does not enclose any content, as indicated by the
EMPTY designation. It turns out to have the same set of attributes as the P element, as
defined by the %attrs entity.
As mentioned in the previous section on the history of HTML, in 1999 the W3C rewrote
HTML as an application of XML and called it XHTML. XML, in this situation, serves the
same purpose as SGML: a language in which to write the rules of a language. In fact, XML is
in some sense just a limited form of SGML. XML and SGML can be used to write arbitrary
markup languages, not just HTML and XHTML. These would be called applications or, maybe
more appropriately, application languages. Numerous markup languages have been defined
with SGML and XML, and you could even define your own if you like. The relationship
between the various markup technologies is shown here:

XHTML

The DTD defined in XML for the XHTML language is actually quite similar to the DTD
for traditional HTML. For example, consider the XHTML DTD entries for the two elements
previously presented:
<!--=================== Paragraphs =====================================-->
<!ELEMENT p %Inline;>
<!ATTLIST p
%attrs;
>

PART I

elements is called the content model. If you further explore the specification to see what that
%inline entity maps out to, you will see that it contains numerous other elements, such as
EM, STRONG, and so on, as well as regular typed text. The final line defines the attributes for
a <P> tag as indicated by the entity %attrs which then expands to a number of entities like
%core, %i18n, and %coreevents which finally expand into a variety of attributes like id,
class, style, title, lang, dir, onclick, ondblclick, and many more. The full syntax
of the P element can be found in the reference in Chapter 3; the aim here is for you to
understand the syntax of SGML in a basic sense to support your understanding of how Web
browsers treat markup.
As another example, look at the HTML 4.01 DTD’s definition of the HR element:

17

18

Part I:

Core Markup

<!--=================== Horizontal Rule ================================-->
<!ELEMENT hr EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST hr
%attrs;
>

As you can see, there is some case changing (lowercase elements), a lack of optional close
tags, and a general cleanup of syntax, but otherwise things are pretty much the same.
Properly constructed (X)HTML documents should reference a DTD of some sort and it
is important to know what this means as browsers and Web quality assurance tools actually
consult the doctype directives. Hopefully, this brief introduction has given you a sense of
the underlying specification of (X)HTML and its degree of detail. Appendix E presents
complete coverage of how to read the (X)HTML DTDs.

NOTE Interestingly, HTML5 does not use SGML or XML definitions, but instead relies on an

English prose specification combined with some formalism. Chapter 3 discusses this change and
some other aspects of the HTML5 language and specification that is different from the older
markup languages.

Document Type Statements and Language Versions
(X)HTML documents should begin with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. This statement
identifies the type of markup that is supposedly used in a document. For example,
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">

indicates that we are using the transitional variation of HTML 4.01 that starts with a root
element html. In other words, an <html> tag will serve as the ultimate parent of all the
content and elements within this document.
A <!DOCTYPE> declaration might get a bit more specific and specify the URI (Uniform
Resource Identifier) of the DTD being used as shown here:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

In the case of an XHTML document, the situation really isn’t much different:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

However, do note that the root html element here is lowercase, which hints at the case
sensitivity found in XHTML.
There are numerous doctype declarations that are found in HTML and XHTML
documents, as shown in Table 1-2.

NOTE On occasion you might see other HTML document type indicators, notably one for the 3.0
standard that was never really adopted in the Web community.

TABLE 1-2

Common HTML Doctype Declarations

While there are many different versions of (X)HTML, the good news is that the rough
document structure defined for each is pretty similar; of course, the bad news is that
little details will be different from version to version, so you need to be precise with your
syntax.

Part I:

Core Markup

(X)HTML Document Structure
The DTDs define the allowed syntax for documents written in that version of (X)HTML.
The core structure of these documents is fairly similar. Given the HTML 4.01 DTD, a basic
document template can be derived from the specification, as shown here:
Doctype statement indicates type of document

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

<html>
<head>
<meta http-equip="Content-Type"
content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>

<body>

Head contains
info about page
Root HTML
element
encloses
entire doc

Body

</body>
</html>

Filename: template.html

In this graphical representation, the <!DOCTYPE> indicator, which, as previously
mentioned, shows the particular version of HTML being used, in this case 4.01 Transitional.
Within a root html element, the basic structure of a document reveals two elements: the head
and the body. The head element contains information and tags describing the document, such
as its title, while the body element houses the document itself, with associated markup
required to specify its structure. HTML5 follows the same core structure but introduces
differences, which is covered in depth in Chapter 2.

Chapter 1:

Alternatively, in either HTML or XHTML (but not in HTML5), we can replace the

<body> tag with a <frameset> tag, which encloses potentially numerous <frame> tags

corresponding to individual portions of the browser window, termed frames. Each frame in
turn would reference another HTML/XHTML document containing either a standard
document, complete with <html>, <head>, and <body> tags, or perhaps yet another
framed document. The <frameset> tag also should include a noframes element that
provides a version of the page for browsers that do not support frames. Within this element,

PART I

The structure of an XHTML document is pretty much the same with the exception of a
different <!DOCTYPE> indicator and an xmlns (XML name space) attribute added to the
html tag so that it is possible to intermix XML more easily into the XHTML document:

21

22

Part I:

Core Markup

a <body> tag should be found for browsers that do not support frames. A visual
representation of this idea is shown here:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01

HTML5 does not support standard frames, though it does preserve inline frames.
Chapter 2 addresses that HTML5–specific change; for now, we’ll concentrate on a typical
document structure and drill into each element until we reach the very characters displayed.
Roughly speaking, the structure of a non-framed (X)HTML document breaks out like so:
Some <!DOCTYPE> statement
HTML

HEAD

BODY

Chapter 1:

Tr a d i t i o n a l H T M L a n d X H T M L

23

The following sections drill into each of the document structuring markup elements and
explore what’s contained inside.

The information in the head element of an (X)HTML document is very important because it
is used to describe or augment the content of the document. The element acts like the front
matter or cover page of a document. In many cases, the information contained within the
head element is information about the page that is useful for visual styling, defining
interactivity, setting the page title, and providing other useful information that describes or
controls the document.

The title Element

A single title element is required in the head element and is used to set the text that most
browsers display in their title bar. The value within a title is also used in a browser’s
history system, recorded when the page is bookmarked, and consulted by search engine
robots to help determine page meaning. In short, it is pretty important to have a
syntactically correct, descriptive, and appropriate page title. Thus, given
<title>Simple HTML Title Example</title>

you will see something like this:

When a title is not specified, most browsers display the URL path or filename instead:

Only one title element should appear in every document, and most user agents will
ignore subsequent tag instances. You should be quite careful about making sure a title
element is well formed because omitting the close tag can cause many browsers to not load
the document. A recent version of Opera reveals what is likely happening in this situation:

Here it appears that the markup and rest of the document are used as the contents of the
unclosed title element, and thus nothing is rendered in the browser. It should be noted that
this particular rendering may vary because some browsers fix an unclosed title.

PART I

The Document Head

24

Part I:

Core Markup

A document title may contain standard text, but markup isn’t interpreted in a <title>
tag, as shown here:

However, character entities such as &copy; (or, alternatively, &#169;), which specifies a
copyright symbol, are allowed in a title:
<title>Simple HTML Title Example, &copy; 2010 WebMonopoly, Inc.</title>

For an entity to be displayed properly, you need to make sure the appropriate character
set is defined and that the browser supports such characters; otherwise, you may see boxes
or other odd symbols in your title:

To set the appropriate character set, you should include a <meta> tag before the page
title even though traditionally title is considered the first element.

NOTE Beyond character set concerns, think twice before using a special character such as a colon

(:), slash (/), or backslash (\) in a document title. An operating system might have a problem
with such a title if the document is saved to the local system. For example, the colon isn’t allowed
within Macintosh filenames, and slashes generally aren’t allowed within filenames, because they
indicate directories. Most modern browsers remove such special characters and reduce them to
spaces during the Save process. To be on the safe side, use dashes to delimit items in a page title.

<meta>: Specifying Content Type, Character Set, and More

A <meta> tag has a number of uses. For example, it can be used to specify values that are
equivalent to HTTP response headers. For example, if you want to make sure that your
MIME type and character set for an English-based HTML document is set, you could use
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">

Because meta is an empty element, you would use the trailing-slash syntax shown here:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" />

Chapter 1:

Tr a d i t i o n a l H T M L a n d X H T M L

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" >

Deciding which MIME type to use isn’t as straightforward. For standard HTML, the
MIME type is always text/html. However, when XHTML is in play, confusion and
browser problems ensue. Numerous pundits bemoan the fact that most XHTML is served as
text/html, particularly because it doesn’t give you the strict parsing that XML tends to
afford. In the use of XHTML, you may choose from text/html, text/xml, application/
xml, and application/xhtml+xml as potential MIME types. Given the potential for
compatibility and even rendering problems, for better or worse, the MIME type text/html
will be used for nearly all (X)HTML examples in this book so that browser rendering is
ensured. This hedge will be explored a bit more later in the chapter when addressing the
implications of XHTML. In summary at the point of writing this edition, it is recommend
specifying a Content-Type of text/html and the UTF-8 character set, and doing so as
your first element within the head, like so:
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" >
<title>Page title here</title>
</head>

NOTE The meta element also has many other uses beyond defining character set and MIME type.

It is also used to set arbitrary name-content pairs to provide meta-information about a document
for purposes like search engine optimization (for example, <meta name="keywords"
content="Keyword1,...Keyword N" > ). Other uses of <meta> tags will be covered in
the reference section of Chapter 3.

Other Elements in the head

In addition to the title and meta elements, under the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 strict
DTDs, the elements allowed within the head element include base, link, object, script,
and style. Comments are also allowed. A brief discussion of the other head elements and
comments follows. Complete information is available in the element reference found in
Chapter 3.

<base> A <base> tag specifies an absolute URL address that is used to provide server
and directory information for partially specified URL addresses, called relative links, used
within the document:
<base href="http://htmlref.com/basexeample" >

Because of its global nature, a <base> tag is often found right after a <title> tag as it
may affect subsequent <script>, <link>, <style>, and <object> tag referenced URIs.

PART I

Most people would agree that using the UTF-8 character set is probably a good idea for
Western-language page authors because it gives them access to international character
glyphs when needed without causing them any trouble:

25

26

Part I:

Core Markup

<link> A <link> tag specifies a special relationship between the current document and
another document. Most commonly, it is used to specify a style sheet used by the document
(as discussed in Chapter 4):
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="global.css" type="text/css" >

However, the <link> tag has a number of other interesting possible uses, such as to set
up navigation relationships and to hint to browsers about pre-cacheable content. See the
element reference in Chapter 3 for more information on this.

<object> An <object> tag allows programs and other binary objects to be directly

embedded in a Web page. Here, for example, a nonvisible Flash object is being referenced
for some use:

<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
width="0" height="0" id="HiddenFlash" >
<param name="movie" value="flashlib.swf" />
</object>

Using an <object> tag involves more than a bit of complexity, and there are numerous
choices of technology, including Java applets, plug-ins, and ActiveX controls.

<script> A <script> tag allows scripting language code to be either directly embedded
within,

<script type="text/javascript">
alert("Hi from JavaScript!");
/* more code below */
</script>

or, more appropriately, linked to from a Web page:
<script type="text/javascript" href="ajaxtcr.js"></script>

Nearly always, JavaScript is the language in use, though other languages such as VBScript
are possible.

<style> A <style> tag is used to enclose document-wide style specifications, typically
in Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) format, relating to fonts, colors, positioning, and other
aspects of content presentation:
<style type="text/css" media="screen">
h1 {font-size: xx-large; color: red; font-style: italic;}
/* all h1 elements render as big, red and italic */
</style>

The use of this tag will be discussed in Chapter 4.

Comments Finally, comments are often found in the head of a document. Following SGML
syntax, a comment starts with <!-- and ends with --> and may encompass many lines:
<!-- Hi I am a comment -->
<!-- Author: Thomas A. Powell

NOTE Correct usage of comments goes well beyond syntax, because they may inherently expose
security concerns on public-facing sites. You’ll also find that comments are used not only for
development notes but also to mask some types of content from browsers.

sensitive to – symbols. Thus

<p>Some body content here.</p>
</body>
</html>

The various details of the tags within the document head are all presented in the
element reference in Chapter 3; the aim here was to show you the organization of the head
element and how it supports the body. Now let’s move on to see the content in the
document body itself.

The Document Body
After the head section, the body of a document is delimited by <body> and </body>. Under
the HTML 4.01 specification and many browsers, the body element is optional, but you
should always include it, particularly because it is required in stricter markup variants.
Only one body element can appear per document.
Within the body of a Web document is a variety of types of elements. For example, blocklevel elements define structural content blocks such as paragraphs (p) or headings (h1-h6).
Block-level elements generally introduce line breaks visually. Special forms of blocks, such
as unordered lists (ul), can be used to create lists of information.
Within nonempty blocks, inline elements are found. There are numerous inline elements,
such as bold (b), italic (i), strong (strong), emphasis (em), and numerous others. These
types of elements do not introduce any returns.

Other miscellaneous types of elements, including those that reference other objects such

though in some versions of HTML they can stand on their own.
Within block and inline elements, you will find textual content, unless the element is
empty. Typed text may include special characters that are difficult to insert from the
keyboard or require special encoding. To use such characters in an HTML document, they
must be “escaped” by using a special code. All character codes take the form &code;, where
code is a word or numeric code indicating the actual character that you want to put
onscreen. For example, when adding a less-than symbol (<) you could use &lt; or &#060;.
Character entities also are discussed in depth in Appendix A.
Finally, just as in the head, you may include comments in the body element.
A visual overview of all the items presented in the body is shown here:

While it might be difficult to meaningfully present the entire syntax of HTML
graphically in a diagram, the diagram presented here should drive home the point that
HTML is quite structured and the details of how elements may be used are quite clear. Now
that you have some insight into the syntax of markup, the next section discusses how
browsers deal with it.

Browsers and (X)HTML
When a browser reads a marked-up document, such as the “hello world” example
repeated here,
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Hello HTML World</title>
<!-- Simple hello world in HTML 4.01 strict example -->
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to the World of HTML</h1>

PART I

Going deeper into the full syntax in a single diagram is unreasonable to present. Just as
an example, take the p element and continue to expand, keeping in mind that these
elements will also loop back on each other and expand out as well:

it builds a parse tree to interpret the structure of the document, possibly like this:

“isn’t so hard!”

“soon you will &hearts; using HTML.”

“You could put lots of text here if you want. We
could go on and on with fake text for you
to read, but let’s get back to the book.”

Chapter 1:

Tr a d i t i o n a l H T M L a n d X H T M L

NOTE The syntax trees presented earlier look very similar to the parse trees, and they should,

because any particular parse tree should be derivable from the particular markup language’s
content model.

Browsers are actually quite permissive in what they will render. For example, consider
the following markup:
<TITLE>Hello HTML World</title>
<!-- Simple hello malformed world -- example -->
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to the World of HTML</H1>
<hr />
<p>HTML <eM>really</Em> isn't so hard!
<P>Soon you will &hearts; using HTML.
<p>You can put lots of text here if you want.
We could go on and on with fake text for you
to read, <foo>but</foo> let's get back to the book.
</html>

This example misses important tags, doesn’t specify encoding types, has a malformed
comment, uses inconsistent casing, doesn’t close tags, and even uses some unknown
element foo. However, this will render exactly the same visually as the correct markup
previously presented, as shown in Figure 1-3.

PART I

These parse trees, often called DOM (Document Object Model) trees, are the browsers’
interpretation of the markup provided and are integral to determining how to render the
page visually using both default (X)HTML style and any CSS attached. JavaScript will also
use this parse tree when scripts attempt to manipulate the document. The parse tree serves
as the skeleton of the page, so making sure that it is correct is quite important, but sadly
we’ll see very often it isn’t.

Now if you look at the parse tree formed by the browser, you will note that many of the
mistakes appear to be magically fixed by the browser:

Of course, the number of assumptions that a browser may make to fix arbitrary
syntactical mistakes is likely quite large and different browsers may assume different
“fixes.” For example, given this small fragment of markup
<p>Making malformed HTML <em><strong>really<em><strong> isn't so hard!</p>

leading browsers will form their parse trees a bit differently, as shown in Figure 1-4.

Validation
As shown earlier, a DTD defines the actual elements, attributes, and element relationships
that are valid in documents. Now you can take a document written in (X)HTML and then
check whether it conforms to the rules specified by the DTD used. This process of checking
whether a document conforms to the rules of the DTD is called validation.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration allows validation software to identify the HTML DTD
being followed in a document, and verify that the document is syntactically correct—in
other words, that all tags used are part of a particular specification and are being used
correctly. An easy way to validate a document is simply to use an online service such as the
W3C Markup Validation Service, at http://validator.w3.org. If the malformed example
from the previous section is passed to this service, it clearly shows that the page has errors:

PART I

Simply put, it is quite important to aim for correct markup as a solid foundation for a
Web page and to not assume the markup is correct just because it appears to render
correctly in your favorite browser.

37

Core Markup

Pass the URL to the service yourself by using this link in the address bar:
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fhtmlref.com%2Fch1%2Fmalforme
dhelloworld.html

By reading the validator’s messages about the errors it detected, you can find and
correct the various mistakes. After all mistakes are corrected, the document should validate
cleanly:

Web developers should aim to start with a baseline of valid markup before trying to
address various browser quirks and bugs. Given that so many Web pages on the Web are
poorly coded, some developers opt to add a “quality” badge to a page to show or even
prove standards conformance:

Conforming
Markup
Supported Malformed Markup

Unsupported Markup

It is an unfortunate reality that browsers support a multitude of incorrect things and
that developers often use a popular browser as an acceptance engine based upon some page
rendering for better or worse. Such an approach to markup testing might seem reasonable
in the short term, but it will ultimately lead to significant developer frustration, particularly
as other technologies are added, such as CSS and JavaScript, and newer browsers are
introduced. Unfortunately, given the browsers’ current method of allowing garbage yet
preferring standards, there is little reason for some developers to care until such a price is
realized.

The Doctype Switch and Browser Rendering Modes
Modern Web browsers generally have two rendering modes: quirks mode and standards
compliance mode. As their names suggest, quirks mode is more permissive and standards
compliance mode is stricter. The browser typically chooses in which mode to parse a
document by inspecting the <!DOCTYPE> statement, if there is one. This process typically is

PART I

Whether users care about such things is debatable, but the aim for correctness is
appropriate. Contrast this to the typical effort of testing a page by viewing it in various
browsers to see what happens. The thought is, if it looks right, then it is right. However, this
does not acknowledge that the set of supported or renderable pages a browser may handle
is a superset of those which are actually conforming to a particular specification:

39

40

Part I:

Core Markup

dubbed the “doctype switch.” When a browser sees a known standards-focused doctype
indicator, it switches into a standards compliant parse:

Strict DTD Present

However, if the <!DOCTYPE> statement is missing, references a very old version like 3.2,
or is unknown, the browser will enter into quirks mode. Browsers may provide an indication
of the rendering mode via an entry in page info:

DTD Missing

In other cases, you may need to use a tool to determine the parse mode:

PART I

Web developers should aim for a solid markup foundation that is parsed in a
predictable manner. The number of rendering oddities that will still be encountered even
with such a solid footing is not inconsequential, so it’s best not to tempt fate and instead to
try to follow the “rules” of markup.

The Rules of (X)HTML
(X)HTML does have rules, of course, though in some versions the rules are somewhat loose.
Similarly, as previously discussed, these “rules” really don’t seem like rules because most
browsers pretty much let just about anything render. However, quite certainly, you should
follow these rules, because malformed documents may have significant downsides, often
exposed only after other technologies like CSS or JavaScript are intermixed with the
markup. The reality is that most (X)HTML, whether created by hand or a tool, generally lies
somewhere between strict conformance and no conformance to the specification. This
section gives you a brief tour of some of the more important aspects of (X)HTML syntax
that are necessary to understand to produce well-formed markup.

HTML Is Not Case Sensitive, XHTML Is
These markup examples are all equivalent under traditional HTML:
<B>Go boldly</B>
<B>Go boldly</b>
<b>Go boldly</B>
<b>Go boldly</b>

In the past, developers were highly opinionated about how to case elements. Some designers
pointed to the ease of typing lowercase tags as well as XHTML’s requirement for lowercase
elements as reasons to go all lowercase. HTML5 reverts back to case-insensitive markup and
thus we may see a return to uppercase tags by standards aware developers.

42

Part I:

Core Markup

Attribute Values May Be Case Sensitive
Consider <img SRC="test.gif"> and <IMG src="test.gif">. Under traditional HTML,
these are equivalent because the <img> tag and the src attribute are not case sensitive.
However, given XHTML, they should always be lowercase. However, just because attribute
names are not case sensitive under traditional HTML, this doesn’t mean every aspect of
attributes is case insensitive.
Regardless of the use of XHTML or HTML, the actual attribute values in some tags may
be case sensitive, particularly where URLs are concerned. So <img src="test.gif"> and
<img src="TEST.GIF"> do not necessarily reference the same image. When referenced
from a UNIX-based Web server, where filenames are case sensitive, test.gif and TEST.GIF
would be two different files, whereas on a Windows Web server, where filenames are not
case sensitive, they would reference the same file. This is a common problem and often
hinders the ability to easily transport a Web site from one server to another.

(X)HTML Is Sensitive to a Single Whitespace Character
Any white space between characters displays as a single space. This includes all tabs, line
breaks, and carriage returns. Consider this markup:
<strong>T e s t o f s p a c e s</strong><br>
<strong>T
e
s
t
o f
s p a c e s </strong><br>
<strong>T
e s
t o f s p
a c e s</strong><br>

As shown here, all the spaces, tabs, and returns are collapsed to a single element:

However, it is possible to force the whitespace issue. If more spaces are required, it is
possible to use the nonbreaking space entity, or &nbsp;. Some consider this the duct tape of
the Web—useful in a bind when a little bit of spacing is needed or an element has to be kept
from collapsing. Yet using markup such as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, I'm spaced out!

would add space to the output, the question is, exactly how far? In print, using spaces to
format is dangerous given font size variability, so text rarely lines up. This is no different on
the Web.
Further note that in some situations, (X)HTML does treat whitespace characters differently.
In the case of the pre element, which defines a preformatted block of text, white space is
preserved rather than ignored because the content is considered preformatted. It is also
possible to use the CSS property white-space to change default whitespace handling.
Because browsers will ignore most white space, Web page authors often format their
documents for readability. However, the reality is that browsers really don’t care one way or
another, nor do end users. Because of this, some sites have adopted a markup optimization
idea, often called crunching or minification, to save bandwidth.

(X)HTML Follows a Content Model

<ul>
<p>What a simple way to break the content model!</p>
</ul>

which often is used for simple indentation, actually doesn’t follow the content model for the
strict (X)HTML specifications. The <ul> tag is only supposed to contain <li> tags. The <p>
tag is not really appropriate in this context. Much of the time, Web page authors are able to
get away with this, but often they can’t. For example, in some browsers, the <input> tag
found outside a <form> tag is simply not displayed, yet in other browsers it is.

Elements Should Have Close Tags Unless Empty
Under traditional HTML, some elements have optional close tags. For example, both of the
paragraphs here are allowed, although the second one is better:
<p>This isn't closed
<p>This is</p>

However, given the content model, the close of the top paragraph can be inferred since its
content model doesn’t allow for another <p> tag to occur within it. HTML5 continues to
allow this, as discussed in Chapter 2.
A few elements, like the horizontal rule (hr) and line break (br), do not have close tags
because they do not enclose any content. These are considered empty elements and can be
used as is in traditional HTML. However, under XHTML you must always close tags, so
you would have to write <br></br> or, more commonly, use a self-closing tag format with
a final “/” character, like so: <br />.

Unused Elements May Minimize
Sometimes tags may not appear to have any effect in a document. Consider, for example,
the <p> tag, which specifies a paragraph. As a block tag, it induces a return by default, but
when used repeatedly, like so,
<p></p><p></p><p></p>

does this produce numerous blank lines? No, since the browser minimizes the empty p
elements. Some HTML editors output nonsense markup such as
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

to deal with this. If this looks like misused markup to you, you’re right!

Elements Should Nest
A simple rule states that tags should nest, not cross; thus
<b><i>is in error as tags cross</b></i>

PART I

All forms of markup support a content model that specifies that certain elements are
supposed to occur only within other elements. For example, markup like this

44

Part I:

Core Markup

whereas
<b><i>is not since tags nest</i></b>

and thus is syntactically correct. All forms of markup, traditional HTML, XHTML, and
HTML5, follow this rule, and while crossing tags may seem harmless, it does introduce
some ambiguity in parse trees. To be a well-formed markup, proper nesting is mandatory.

Attributes Should Be Quoted
Under traditional HTML as well as under HTML5, simple attribute values do not need to be
quoted. If the attribute contains only alphanumeric content, dashes, and periods, then the
quotes can safely be removed; so,
<img src=robot.gif height=10 width=10 alt=robot>

would work fine in most browsers and would validate. However, the lack of quotes can
lead to trouble, especially when scripting is involved. Quotes should be used under
transitional markup forms and are required under strict forms like XHTML; so,
<img src="robot.gif" height="10" width="10" alt="robot" />

would be the correct form of the tag. Generally, it doesn’t matter whether you use single or
double quotes, unless other quotes are found within the quotes, which is common with
JavaScript or even with CSS when it is found in an attribute value. Stylistically, double
quotes tend to be favored, but either way you should be consistent.

Entities Should Be Used for Special Characters
Markup parsers are sensitive to special characters used for the markup itself, like < and >.
Instead of writing these potentially parse-dangerous characters in the document, they should
be escaped out using a character entity. For example, instead of <, use &lt; or the numeric
equivalent &#60;. Instead of >, use &gt; or &#62;. Given that the ampersand character has
special meaning in an entity, it would need to be escaped as well using &amp; or &#38;.
Beyond escaping characters, it is necessary to insert special characters for special quote
characters, legal symbols like copyright and trademark, currency, math, dingbats, and a
variety of other difficult-to-type symbols. Such characters are also inserted with entities. For
example, to insert the Yen symbol (¥), you would use &yen; or &#165;. With Unicode in
play, there is a vast range of characters to choose from, but unfortunately there are
difficulties in terms of compatibility, all of which is discussed in Appendix A.

Browsers Ignore Unknown Attributes and Elements
For better or worse, keep in mind that browsers will ignore unknown elements and
attributes; so,
<bogus>this text will display on screen</bogus>

and markup such as
<p id="myPara" obviouslybadattribute="TRUE">will also render fine.</p>

Major Themes of (X)HTML
The major themes addressed in this section are deep issues that you will encounter over and
over again throughout the book.

Logical and Physical Markup
No introduction to (X)HTML would be complete without a discussion of the logical
versus physical markup battle. Physical markup refers to using a markup language such
as (X)HTML to make pages look a particular way; logical markup refers to using (X)HTML
to specify the structure or meaning of content while using another technology, such as CSS,
to designate the look of the page. We begin a deeper exploration of CSS in Chapter 4.
Physical markup is obvious; if you want to highlight something that is important to the
reader, you might embolden it by enclosing it within a <b> tag:
<b>This is important!</b>

This simple approach fits with the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) world of programs
such as Microsoft Word.
Logical markup is a little less obvious; to indicate the importance of the phrase, it should
be enclosed in the logical strong element:
<strong>This is important.</strong>

Interestingly, the default rendering of this would be to embolden the text. Given the
difference, it seems the simpler, more obvious approach of using a <b> tag is the way to go.
However, actually the semantic meaning of strong provides a bit more flexibility and is
preferred. Remember, the <strong> tag is used to say that something is important content,
not to indicate how it looks. If a CSS rule were defined to say that important items should
be big, red, and italic
<style="text/css">
strong {font-size: xx-large; color: red; font-style: italic;}
</style>

confusion would not necessarily ensue, because we shouldn’t have a predisposed view of
what strong means visually. However, if we presented a CSS rule to make <b> tags act
as such, it makes less sense because we assume that the meaning of the tag is simply to
embolden some text.

PART I

Browsers make best guesses at structuring malformed content and tend to ignore code
that is obviously wrong. The permissive nature of browsers has resulted in a massive number
of malformed HTML documents on the Web. Oddly, from many people’s perspective, this
isn’t an issue, because the browsers do make sense out of the “tag soup” they find. However,
such a cavalier use of the language creates documents with shaky foundations at best. Once
other technologies such as CSS and JavaScript are thrown into the mix, brazen flaunting of the
rules can have repercussions and may result in broken pages. Furthermore, to automate the
exchange of information on the Web, collectively we need to enforce stricter structure of our
documents. The focus on standards-based Web development and future development of
XHTML and HTML5 brings some hope for stability and structure of Web documents.

45

46

Part I:

Core Markup

HTML unfortunately mixes logical and physical markup thinking. Even worse, common
renderings are so familiar to developers that tags that are logical are assumed physical. What
does an <h1> tag do? Most Web developers would say it defines a big heading. However,
that is assuming a physical view; it is simply saying that the enclosed content is a level one
heading. How such a heading looks is completely arbitrary. While many of HTML’s logical
elements are relatively underutilized, others, such as headings and paragraphs (<p>), are
used regularly though they are generally thought of as physical tags by most HTML users.
Consider that people generally consider <h1> a large heading, <h2> a smaller heading, and
predict that <p> tags cause returns and you can see that, logical or not, the language is physical
to most of its users. However, does that have to be the case? No, these are logical elements and
the renderings, while common, are not required and CSS easily can change them.
The benefits of logical elements might not be obvious to those comfortable with physical
markup. To understand the benefits, it’s important to realize that on the Web, many browsers
render things differently. In addition, predicting what the viewing environment will be is
difficult. What browser does the user have? What is his or her monitor’s screen resolution?
Does the user even have a screen? Considering the extreme of the user having no screen at
all, how would a speaking browser render a <b> tag? What about a <strong> tag? Text
tagged with <strong> might be read in a firm voice, but boldfaced text might not have an
easily translated meaning outside the visual realm.
Many realistic examples exist of the power of logical elements. Consider the
international aspects of the Web. In some countries, the date is written with the day first,
followed by the month and year. In the United States, the date generally is written with
the month first, and then the day and year. A <date> or a <time> tag, the latter of which
is actually now part of HTML5, could tag the information and enable the browser to
localize it for the appropriate viewing environment. In short, separation of the logical
structure from the physical presentation allows multiple physical displays to be applied
to the same content. This is a powerful idea which, unfortunately, even today is rarely
taken advantage of.
Whether you subscribe to the physical (specific) or logical (general) viewpoint,
traditional HTML is neither purely physical nor purely logical, at least not yet. In other
words, currently used HTML elements come in both flavors, physical and logical, though
users nearly always think of them as physical. This is likely not going to get settled soon;
the battle between logical and physical markup predates HTML by literally decades.
HTML5 will certainly surprise any readers who are already logical markup fans, because
it fully preserves traditional presentational tags like <b> and <i>, given their common
use, though jumps through some interesting mental hoops to claim meaning is changed.
Further, the new specification promotes media- and visual-focused markup like
<canvas> and <video> and introduces tremendously powerful navigational and
sectioning logical-focused tags. If recent history is any guide, then HTML5 is likely going
to pick up many fans.

Standards vs. Practice
Just because a standard is defined doesn’t necessarily mean that it will be embraced. Many
Web developers simply do not know or care about standards. As long as their page looks
right in their favorite browser, they are happy and will continue to go on abusing HTML
tags like <table> and using various tricks and proprietary elements. CSS has really done

Myths and Misconceptions About HTML and XHTML
The amount of hearsay, myths, and complete misunderstandings about HTML and XHTML
is enormous. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that many people simply view the
page source of sites or read quick tutorials to learn HTML. This section covers a few of the
more common misconceptions about HTML and tries to expose the truth behind them.

Misconception: WYSIWYG Works on the Web

(X)HTML isn’t a specific, screen- or printer-precise formatting language like PostScript.
Many people struggle with HTML on a daily basis, trying to create perfect layouts using
(X)HTML elements inappropriately or using images to make up for HTML’s lack of screen
and font-handling features. Interestingly, even the concept of a visual WYSIWG editor
propagates this myth of HTML as a page layout language. Other technologies, such as CSS,
are far better than HTML for handling presentation issues and their use returns HTML to its
structural roots. However, the battle to make the end user see exactly what you see on your
screen is likely to be a futile one.

Misconception: HTML Is a Programming Language

Many people think that making HTML pages is similar to programming. However, HTML
is unlike programming in that it does not specify logic. It specifies the structure of a
document. The introduction of scripting languages such as JavaScript into Web documents
and the confusing terms Dynamic HTML (DHTML) and Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript
and XML) tacked on may lead many to overestimate or underestimate the role of markup in
the mix. However, markup is an important foundation for scripting and should be treated
with the same syntactical precision that script is given.

Misconception: XHTML Is the Only Future

Approaching its tenth birthday, XHTML still has yet to make much inroads in the widespread
building of Web pages. Sorry to say, most documents are not authored in XHTML, and many

PART I

little to change this thinking, with the latest browser hacks and filters as popular as the pixel
tricks and table hacks of the generation before. Developers tend to favor that which is easy
and seems to work, so why bother to put more time in, particularly if browsers render the
almost right markup with little complaint and notice?
Obviously, this “good enough” approach simply isn’t good enough. Without standards,
the modern world wouldn’t work well. For example, imagine a world of construction in
which every nut and bolt might be a slightly different size. Standards provide needed
consistency. The Web needs standards, but standards have to acknowledge what people
actually do. Declaring that Web developers really need to validate, use logical markup, and
separate the look from the structure of the document is great but it doesn’t get them to do
so. Standards are especially pointless if they are never widely implemented.
Web technologies today are like English—widely understood but poorly spoken. However,
at the same time they are the Latin of the Web, providing a strong foundation for development
and intersecting with numerous technologies. Web standards and development practices
provide an interesting study of the difference between what theorists say and what people
want and do. HTML5 seems a step in the right direction. The specification acknowledges that,
for better or worse, traditional HTML practices are here for now, and thus attempts to make
them solid while continuing to move technology forward and encourage correct usage.

47

48

Part I:

Core Markup

of those that are, are done incorrectly. Poor developer education, the more stringent syntax
requirements, and ultimately the lack of obvious tangible benefit may have kept many from
adopting the XML variant of HTML.

Misconception: XHTML Is Dead

Although XHTML hasn’t taken Web development by storm, the potential rise of HTML5
does not spell the end of XHTML. In fact, you can write XML-style markup in HTML,
which most developers dub XHTML 5. For precision, XHTML is the way to go, particularly
when used in an environment that includes other forms of XML documents. XHTML’s
future is bright for those who build well-formed, valid markup documents.

Myth: Traditional HTML Is Going Away

HTML is the foundation of the Web; with literally billions of pages in existence, not every
document is going to be upgraded anytime soon. The “legacy” Web will continue for years,
and traditional nonstandardized HTML will always be lurking around underneath even the
most advanced Web page years from now. Beating the standards drum might speed things
up a bit, but the fact is, there’s a long way to go before we are rid of messed-up markup.
HTML5 clearly acknowledges this point by documenting how browsers should act in light
of malformed markup.
Having taught HTML for years and having seen how both HTML editors and people
build Web pages, I think it is very unlikely that strictly conforming markup will be the norm
anytime soon. Although (X)HTML has had rules for years, people have not really bothered to
follow them; from their perspective, there has been little penalty for failing to follow the
rules, and there is no obvious benefit to actually studying the language rigorously. Quite
often, people learn markup simply through imitation by viewing the source of existing
pages, which are not necessarily written correctly, and going from there. Like learning a
spoken language, (X)HTML’s loosely enforced rules have allowed many document authors
to get going quickly. Its biggest flaw is in some sense its biggest asset and has allowed
millions of people to get involved with Web page authoring. Rigor and structure is coming,
but it will take time, tools, and education.

Myth: Someday Standards Will Alleviate All Our Problems

Standards are important. Standards should help. Standards likely won’t fix everything.
From varying interpretations of standards, proprietary additions, and plain old bugs, there
is likely never going to be a day where Web development, even at the level of (X)HTML
markup, doesn’t have its quirks and oddities. The forces of the market so far have proven
this sentiment to be, at the very least, wishful thinking. Over a decade after first being
considered during the writing of this book’s first edition, the wait for some standards
nirvana continues.

Myth: Hand-Coding of HTML Will Continue Indefinitely

Although some people will continue to craft pages in a manner similar to mechanical
typesetting, as Web editors improve and produce standard markup perfectly, the need to
hand-tweak HTML documents will diminish. Hopefully, designers will realize that knowledge
of the “invisible pixel” trick or the CSS Box Model Hack is not a bankable resume item and
instead focus on development of their talents along with a firm standards-based understanding
of markup, CSS, and JavaScript.

Myth: (X)HTML Is the Most Important Technology Needed to Create Web Pages

The Future of Markup—Two Paths?
Having followed markup for well over a decade in writing editions of this book and
beyond, it is still quite difficult to predict what will happen with it in the future, other than
to say the move towards strict markup will likely be a bit slower than people think and
probably not ideal. The sloppy syntax from the late 1990s is still with us and is likely to be
so for some time. The desire to change this is strong, but so far the battle for strict markup is
far from won. We explore here two competing, or potentially complementary, paths for the
future of markup.

XHTML: Web Page Markup XML Style
A new version of HTML called XHTML became a W3C recommendation in January 2000.
XHTML, as discussed earlier in the chapter, is a reformulation of HTML using XML that
attempts to change the direction and use of HTML to the way it ought to be. So what does
that mean? In short, rules now matter. As you know, you can feed a browser just about
anything and it will render. XHTML would aim to end that. Now if you make a mistake, it
should matter.
Theoretically, a strictly XHTML-conforming browser shouldn’t render a page at all if it
doesn’t conform to the standard, though this is highly unlikely to happen because browsers
resort to a backward-compatibility quirks mode to display such documents. The question is,
could you enforce the strict sense of XML using XHTML? The short answer is, maybe not
ideally.
To demonstrate, let’s reformulate the xhtmlhelloworld.html example slightly by adding
an XML directive and forcing the MIME type to be XML. We’ll then try to change the file
extension to .xml to ensure that the server gets the browser to really treat the file as XML data.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/xml; charset=utf-8" />
<title>Hello XHTML World</title>
<!-- Simple hello world in XHTML 1.0 strict example -->
</head>

PART I

Whereas (X)HTML is the basis for Web pages, you need to know a lot more than markup to
build useful Web pages (unless the page is very simple). However, don’t underestimate
markup, because it can become a bit of a challenge itself. Based on the simple examples
presented in this chapter, you might surmise that mastering Web page creation is merely a
matter of learning the multitude of markup tags, such as <h1>, <p>, <em>, and so on, that
specify the structure of Web documents to browsers. While this certainly is an important
first step, it would be similar to believing you could master the art of writing by simply
understanding the various commands available in Microsoft Word. There is a tremendous
amount to know in the field of Web design and development, including information
architecture, visual design, client- and server-side programming, marketing and search
engines, Web servers and delivery, and much, much more.

Interestingly, most browsers, save Internet Explorer, will not have a problem with this.
Internet Explorer will treat the apparent XML acting as HTML as normal HTML markup,
but if we force the issue, it will parse it as XML and then render an XML tree rather than a
default rendering:

Correct Render

Parse Tree

To get the benefit of using XML, we need to explore if syntax checking is really enforced.
Turns out that works if the browser believes markup to be XML, but not if the browser gets
the slightest idea that we mean for content to be HTML. See for yourself when you try the
examples that follow. You should note it properly fails when it assumes XML and not when
it suspects HTML.

PART I

NOTE The example presented is quite simple and meant to show the possibility of XHTML if it

were fully realized. Note that as soon as you start adding markup with internal CSS and
JavaScript, the amount of work to get rendering working in browsers increases substantially.

In summary, if a browser really believes it is getting XML, it will enforce parsing rules
and force well-formedness. Regardless of whether rules are enforced or not, without
Internet Explorer rendering markup visually, it would appear that we have to deliver
XHTML as standard HTML, as mentioned earlier in the chapter, which pretty much makes
the move to an XML world pointless.

NOTE As this edition of the book was wrapped up, the future of XHTML 2 became murky because

the W3C announced that it was letting the XHTML2 Working Group’s charter expire. This,
however, should not be taken to indicate that XML applied to HTML is dead; it does indeed live
on under HTML5.

HTML5: Back to the Future
Starting in 2004, a group of well-known organizations and individuals got together to form a
standards body called the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, or
WHATWG (www.whatwg.org), whose goal was to produce a new version of HTML. The exact
reasons and motivations for this effort seem to vary depending on who you talk to—slow
uptake of XHTML, frustration with the lack of movement by the Web standards body, need for
innovation, or any one of many other reasons—but, whatever the case, the aim was to create a
new, rich future for Web applications that include HTML as a foundation element. Aspects of
the emerging specification such as the canvas element have already shown up in browsers
like Safari and Firefox, so by 2008, the efforts of this group were rolled into the W3C and drafts
began to emerge. Whether this makes HTML5 become official or likely to be fully adopted is
obviously somewhat at the mercy of the browser vendors and the market, but clearly another
very likely path for the future of markup goes through HTML5. Already we see Google
adopting it in various places, so its future looks bright.

NOTE While HTML5 stabilized somewhat around October 2009, with a W3C final candidate

recommendation goal of 2012, you are duly warned that the status of HTML5 may change.
Because of the early nature of the specification, specific documentation of HTML5 focuses more on
what works now than on what may make it into the specification later.

HTML5 is meant to represent a new version of HTML along the HTML 4 path. The
emerging specification also suggests that it will be a replacement for XHTML, yet it ends up
supporting most of the syntax that end users actually use, particularly self-identifying
empty elements (for example, <br />). It also reverses some of the trends, such as case
sensitivity, that have entered into markup circles, so it would seem that the HTML styles of
the past will be fine in the future. In most ways, HTML5 doesn’t present much of a
difference, as you saw earlier in the chapter’s introductory example, shown again here:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Hello HTML World</title>

Tr a d i t i o n a l H T M L a n d X H T M L

In the next chapter, we’ll see that HTML5 is quite a bit different than HTML 4 despite what
our “hello world” example suggests. There are many new tags and there is a tremendous
emphasis on interactivity and Web application development. However, probably the most
interesting aspect of HTML5 is the focus on defining what browsers—or, more widely, user
agents in general—are supposed to do when they encounter ill-formed markup. HTML5, by
defining known outcomes, makes it much more likely that today’s “tag soup” will be parsed
predictably by tomorrow’s browsers. Unfortunately, read another way, it provides yet more
reasons for those who create such a mess of markup not to change their bad habits.
Likely, the future of markup has more than one possible outcome. My opinion is that
those who produce professional-grade markup or who write tools to do so will continue to
embrace standards, XML or not, while those who dabble with code and have fun will
continue to work with little understanding of the rules they break and will have no worries
about doing so. The forgiveness that HTML allows is both the key to its popularity and,
ultimately, the curse of the unpredictability often associated with it.

Summary
HTML is the markup language for building Web pages and traditionally has combined
physical and logical structuring ideas. Elements—in the form of tags such as <em> and
</em>—are embedded within text documents to indicate to browsers how to render pages.
The rules for HTML are fairly simple and compliance can be checked with a process called
validation. Unfortunately, these rules have not been enforced by browsers in the past.
Because of this looseness, there has been a great deal of misunderstanding about the
purpose of HTML, and a good portion of the documents on the Web do not conform to any
particular official specification of HTML. Stricter forms of HTML, and especially the
introduction of XHTML, attempt to impose a more rigid syntax, encourage logical markup,
and leave presentational duties to other technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets. While
very widespread, use of strict markup has yet to occur on the Web. Web developers should
aim to meet standards to future-proof their documents and more easily address all the
various issues that will certainly arise in getting browsers to render them properly.

PART I

All that is different in this example is that the <!DOCTYPE> statement is much simpler. In
fact, the specific idea of using SGML and performing validation does not apply to HTML5.
However, the syntax checking benefits of validation lives on and is now being called
conformance checking and for all intents and purposes is the same. Interestingly, because
of the statement in its shortened form, browsers will correctly enter into a standards
compliance mode when they encounter an HTML5 document:

CHAPTER

Introducing HTML5

T

he HTML5 specification not only embraces the past, by supporting traditional
HTML- and XHTML-style syntax, but also adds a wide range of new features.
Although HTML5 moves forward from HTML 4, it also is somewhat of a retreat and
an admission that trying to get every Web developer on the Internet to write their markup
properly is a futile effort, particularly because few Web developers are actually formally
trained in the technology. HTML5 tries to bring order to chaos by codifying common
practices, embracing what is already implemented in browsers, and documenting how
these user agents (browsers or other programs that consume Web pages) should deal with
our imperfect markup.
HTML5’s goals are grand. The specification is sprawling and often misunderstood.
Given the confusion, the goals of this chapter are not only to summarize what is new about
HTML5 and provide a roadmap to the element reference that follows, but to also expose
some of the myths and misconceptions about this exciting new approach to markup.

NOTE Perhaps just to be new, HTML5 omits the space found commonly between (X)HTML and its

version number, as in HTML 4 or XHTML 1. We follow this style generally in the book, but note
even the specification has not been stringent on this point.

Hello HTML5
The syntax of HTML5 should be mostly familiar. As shown in the previous chapter, a simple
HTML5 document looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Hello HTML5 World</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello HTML5</h1>
<p>Welcome to the future of markup!</p>
</body>
</html>

Part I:

Core Markup

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/helloworld.html
For all practical purposes, all that is different from standard HTML in this example is
the <!DOCTYPE> statement. Given such minimal changes, of course, basic HTML5 will
immediately render correctly in browsers, as demonstrated in Figure 2-1.
As indicated by its atypical <!DOCTYPE> statement, HTML5 is not defined as an SGML
or XML application. Because of the non-SGML/XML basis for HTML, there is no concept of
validation in HTML5; instead, an HTML5 document is checked for conformance to the
specification, which provides the same practical value as validation. So the lack of a formal
DTD is somewhat moot. As an example, consider the following flawed markup:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Hello Malformed HTML5 World</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- note bad close tag below -->
<h1>Hello Malformed HTML5<h1>
<!-- unknown tag found here -->
<p>Welcome to the <danger>future</danger> of markup!</p>
<!-- missing </body> -->
</html>

NOTE Given the currently fluid nature of HTML5, developers are warned that, at least for now,
HTML5 conformance may be a bit of a moving target.

If you are wondering what mode the browser enters into because of the divergent

<!DOCTYPE> used by HTML5, apparently it is the more standards-oriented mode:

Employing the more standards-oriented parsing mode might seem appropriate, but it is
somewhat odd given the point of the next section.

Loose Syntax Returns
An interesting aspect of HTML5 is the degree of syntax variability that it allows. Unlike its
stricter markup cousin, XHTML, the traditional looseness of HTML is allowed. To demonstrate,
in the following example, quotes are not always employed, major elements like html, head,
and body are simply not included, the inference of close of tags like </p> and </li> is
allowed, case is used variably, and even XML-style self-identifying close syntax is used at will:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- I have no html, head, or body as they are actually optional -->
<meta http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>HTML5 Tag Soup Test</title>
<h1 title="more sloppy markup ahead!">HTML5</H1>
<p id=p1>Back to the future of loose markup!?
<p>Yes it looks that way

59

This example, at least currently, conforms to the HTML5 specification:

PART I

Do not interpret the previous example to mean that HTML5 allows a markup free-for-all.
Understand that these “mistakes” are actually allowed under traditional HTML and thus
are allowed under HTML5. To ensure that you conform to the HTML5 specification, you
should be concerned primarily about the following:
• Make sure to nest elements, not cross them; so
<b><i>is in error as tags cross</b></i>

whereas
<b><i>is not since tags nest</i></b>.

• Quote attribute values when they are not ordinal values, particularly if they contain
special characters, particularly spaces; so
<p id=p1>Fine with no quotes</p>

because it is a simple attribute value, whereas
<p title=trouble here with no quotes>Not ok without quotes</p>

is clearly messed up.
• Understand and follow the content model. Just because one browser may let you
use a list item anywhere you like,
<li>I should be in a list!</li>

it isn’t correct. Elements must respect their content model, so the example should
read instead as
<ul><li>All is well I am in a list!</li></ul>

because it follows HTML5’s content model.

60

Part I:

Core Markup

• Do not use invented tags unless they are included via some other markup language:
<p>I <danger>shouldn't</danger> conform unless I am defined in
another specification and use a name space</p>

• Encode special characters, particularly those used in tags (< >), either as an entity
of a named form, such as &lt;, or as a numeric value, such as &#60;. Appendix A
covers this topic in some depth.
This brief list of what you should do might seem familiar; it is pretty much the list of
recommendations for correct markup from the previous chapter returned to the traditional
markup styles of HTML. What this means is that if you have been writing markup correctly
in the past, HTML5 isn’t going to present much of a change. In fact, in many cases, just by
changing a valid document’s doctype to the new simple HTML5 <!DOCTYPE html>, the
result should be an HTML5–conforming document.

XHTML5
For those with a heavy investment in a strict XHTML syntax worldview, HTML5 might
seem like a slap in the face. However, such a reaction is a bit premature; HTML5 neither
makes the clean markup you write non-conforming nor suggests that you shouldn’t author
markup this way. If you want to pursue an “XMLish” approach to your document, HTML5
allows it. Consider, for example, a strict XHTML example that is now HTML5:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<title>Hello XHTML5 World</title>
<!-- Simple hello world in XHTML5 -->
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to the World of XHTML5</h1>
<hr />
<p>XHTML5 <em>really</em> isn't so hard either!</p>
<p>HTML5 likes XML syntax too.</p>
<p>Make sure to serve it with the correct MIME type!</p>
<!-- IE users you will get a render error.
Please read on to learn why. -->
</body>
</html>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/xhtml5helloworld.xhtml
NOTE When using XML syntax with HTML5 according to HTML5 specification, this should be
termed XHTML5.

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

FIGURE 2-2

XHTML5 works, but Internet Explorer support lags.

PART I

Notice that the previous example uses an .xhtml file extension. XHTML5 usage clearly
indicates that an HTML5 document written to XML syntax must be served with the MIME
type application/xhtml+xml or application/xml. The previous example was served
with the former MIME type. You can find the same example served with latter XML MIME
type at http://htmlref.com/ch2/xhtml5helloworld.xml.
Unfortunately, although HTML5 supports XML, the real value of XHTML—the true
strictness of XML—has not been realized, at least so far, because of a lack of browser
support. As of this edition’s writing, Internet Explorer browsers (up to version 8) will not
render XHTML served with the appropriate application/xhtml+xml MIME type and
will take the raw XML form and render it as a parse tree. Other browsers, fortunately, don’t
do this (see Figure 2-2), which is little solace given Internet Explorer’s widespread usage.
You can write XMLish markup and serve it as text/html but it won’t provide the
benefit of strict syntax conformance. In short, HTML5 certainly allows you to try to
continue applying the intent of XHTML in the hopes that someday it becomes viable.

Part I:

Core Markup

HTML5: Embracing the Reality of Web Markup
Given the looseness HTML5 supports and its de-emphasis of the XML approach to markup,
you might assume that HTML5 is a retreat from doing things in the right way and an
acceptance of “tag soup” as legitimate markup. The harsh reality is that, indeed, valid
markup is more the exception than the rule online. Numerous surveys have shown that in
the grand scheme of things, few Web sites validate. For example, in a study of the Alexa
Global Top 500 in January 2008, only 6.57 percent of the sites surveyed validated.1 When
sample sizes are increased and we begin to look at sites that are not as professional, things
actually get worse. Some validation results from Opera’s larger MAMA (Metadata Analysis
and Mining Application) study are shown here2:

Interestingly, Google has even larger studies, and while they don’t focus specifically on
validation, what they indicate on tag usage indicates clearly that no matter the sample size,
clean markup is more the exception than the rule.
Yet despite the markup madness, the Web continues to work. In fact, some might say the
permissive nature of browsers that parse junk HTML actually helps the Web grow because it
lowers the barrier to entry for new Web page authors. Certainly a shaky foundation to build
upon, but the stark reality is that we must deal with malformed markup. To this end, HTML5
makes one very major contribution: it defines what to do in the presence of markup syntax
problems.
The permissive nature of browsers is required for browsers to fix markup mistakes. HTML5
directly acknowledges this situation and aims to define how browsers should parse both wellformed and malformed markup, as indicated by this brief excerpt from the specification:
This specification defines the parsing rules for HTML documents, whether they
are syntactically correct or not. Certain points in the parsing algorithm are said
to be parse errors. The error handling for parse errors is well-defined: user agents
must either act as described below when encountering such problems, or must
abort processing at the first error that they encounter for which they do not wish
to apply the rules described below.
While a complete discussion of the implementation of an HTML5–compliant browser
parser is of little interest to Web document authors, browser implementers now have a
common specification to consult to determine what to do when tags are not nested, simply
left open, or mangled in a variety of ways. This is the part of the HTML5 specification that

Introducing HTML5

Presentational Markup Removed and Redefined
HTML5 removes a number of elements and attributes. Many of the elements are removed
because they are more presentational than semantic. Table 2-1 presents the elements
currently scheduled for removal from HTML5.

NOTE Although these elements are removed from the specification and should be avoided in favor of

CSS, they likely will continue to be supported by browsers for some time to come. The specification
even acknowledges this fact.

Looking at Table 2-1, you might notice that some elements that apparently should be
eliminated somehow live on. For example, <small> continues to be allowed, but <big> is
obsolete. The idea here is to preserve elements but shift meaning. For example, <small> is
no longer intended to correspond to text that is just reduced in size, similar to <font
size="-1"> or <span style="font-size: smaller;">, but instead is intended to
represent the use of small text, such as appears in fine print or legal information. If you
think this decision seems a bit preposterous, join the crowd. Some of the other changes to
element meaning seem even a bit more preposterous, such as the claim that a <b> tag now
represents inline text that is stylistically offset from standard text, typically using a different

will likely produce the most good, because obtaining consensus among browser vendors to
handle markup problems in a consistent manner is a more likely path to an improved Web
than defining some strict syntax and then attempting to educate document authors around
the world en masse to write good markup.
HTML5’s aim to bring order to the chaos of sloppy markup is but one of the grand
aims of the specification. It also aims to replace traditional HTML, XHTML, and DOM
specifications, and to do so in a backward-compatible fashion. In its attempt to do this, the
specification is sprawling, addressing not just what elements exist but how they are used
and scripted. HTML5 embraces the fact that the Web not only is composed of documents
but also supports applications, thus markup must acknowledge and facilitate the building
of such applications. More of the philosophy of HTML5 will be discussed later in the
chapter when addressing some strong opinions, myths, and misconceptions surrounding
the specification; for now, take a look at what markup features HTML5 actually changes.

type treatment. So apparently <b> tags are not necessarily bold, but rather convey some
sense that the text is “different” (which likely means bold). Unlikely to be thought of in such
a manner by mere markup mortals, we simply say <b> tags live on, as do a number of other
presentational elements. Table 2-2 presents the meaning-changed elements that stay put in
HTML5 and their new meaning.
The meaning of some of these items might not be immediately clear, but don’t worry
about that now, because each will be demonstrated later in the chapter and a full reference
presented in Chapter 3.
Like the strict variants of (X)HTML, HTML5 also removes numerous presentationfocused attributes. Table 2-3 summarizes these values and presents CSS alternatives.

Out with the Old Elements
A few elements are removed from the HTML5 specification simply because they are archaic,
misunderstood, have usability concerns, or have a function that is equivalent to the function
of other elements. Table 2-4 summarizes some of the elements that have been removed from
the HTML5 specification.

NOTE While frames are mostly removed from HTML5, inline frames live on. See the section “The
Uncertain Future of Frames,” later in the chapter, for more information.

Table 2-4 is not a complete list of non-conforming elements, just the ones that are supported
by recent HTML 4 and XHTML 1.x specifications. Discussing the fact that ancient tags like
<listing> and <plaintext> continue not to be supported or that all the presentational tags

Chapter 3 covers compliance points completely, so when in doubt check the appropriate
element’s entry.

In with the New Elements
For most Web page authors, the inclusion of new elements is the most interesting aspect of
HTML5. Some of these elements are not yet supported, but already many browsers are
implementing a few of the more interesting ones, such as audio and video, and others can
easily be simulated even if they are not directly understood yet, as you will see later in the
chapter. Table 2-5 summarizes the elements added by HTML5 at the time of this edition’s
writing, and the sections that follow illustrate their use. Again, Chapter 3 provides
a complete element syntax discussion.

Sample of New Attributes for HTML5
One quite important aspect of HTML5 is the introduction of new attributes. There are quite
a few attributes that are global and thus found on all elements. Table 2-6 provides a brief
overview of these attributes. We’ll take a look at many of these in upcoming sections and
a complete reference for all is found in the next chapter.
The element reference in Chapter 3 provides the full syntax for the various HTML5
attributes that may have been added to specific elements. Some of them, such as reversed
for use on ordered lists (<ol>), are a long time in coming, while others simply add polish, or
address details that few page authors may notice.

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

Description

article

Encloses a subset of a document that forms an independent part of a document,
such as a blog post, article, or self-continued unit of information.

aside

Encloses content that is tangentially related to the other content in an enclosing
element such as section.

audio

Specifies sound to be used in a Web page.

canvas

Defines a region to be used for bitmap drawing using JavaScript.

command

Located within a menu element, defines a command that a user may invoke.

datalist

Indicates the data items that may be used as quick choices in an input element of
type="list".

details

Defines additional content that can be shown on demand.

figure

Defines a group of content that should be used as a figure and may be labeled by a
legend element.

footer

Represents the footer of a section or the document and likely contains
supplementary information about the related content.

header

Represents the header of a section or the document and contains a label or other
heading information for the related content.

hgroup

Groups heading elements (h1–h6) for sectioning or subheading purposes.

mark

Indicates marked text and should be used in a similar fashion to show how a
highlighter is used on printed text.

meter

Represents a scalar measurement in a known range similar to what may be
represented by a gauge.

nav

Encloses a group of links to serve as document or site navigation.

output

Defines a region that will be used to hold output from some calculation or form
activity.

progress

Indicates the progress of a task toward completion, such as displayed in a progress
meter or loading bar.

rp

Defines parentheses around ruby text defined by an rt element.

rt

Defines text used as annotations or pronunciation guides. This element will be
enclosed within a ruby element.

ruby

This is the primary element and may include rt and rp elements. A ruby element
serves as a reading or pronunciation guide. It is commonly used in Asian languages,
such as in Japanese to present information about Kanji characters.

Description

accesskey

Defines the accelerator key to be used for keyboard access to an element.

contenteditable

When set to true, the browser should allow the user to edit the content of
the element. Does not specify how the changed content is saved.

contextmenu

Defines the DOM id of the menu element to serve as a context menu for
the element the attribute is defined on.

data-X

Specifies user-defined metadata that may be put on tags without concern of
collision with current or future attributes. Use of this type of attribute avoids
the common method of creating custom attributes or overloading the class
attribute.

draggable

When specified, should allow the element and its content to be dragged.

hidden

Under HTML5, all elements may have hidden attribute which when placed
indicates the element is not relevant and should not be rendered. This
attribute is similar to the idea of using the CSS display property set to a
value of none.

itemid

Sets a global identifier for a microdata item. This is an optional attribute, but
if it is used, it must be placed in an element that sets both the itemscope
and itemtype attributes. The value must be in the form of a URL.

itemprop

Adds a name/value pair to an item of microdata. Any child of a tag with an
itemscope attribute can have an itemprop attribute set in order to add a
property to that item.

itemref

Specifies a list of space-separated elements to traverse in order to find
additional name/value pairs for a microdata item. By default, an item
only searches the children of the element that contains the itemscope
attribute. However, sometimes it does not make sense to have a single
parent item if the data is intermingled. In this case, the itemref attribute
can be set to indicate additional elements to search. The attribute is
optional, but if it is used, it must be placed in an element that sets the
itemscope attribute.

itemscope

Sets an element as an item of microdata (see “Microdata” later in the
chapter).

itemtype

Defines a global type for a microdata item. This is an optional attribute,
but if it is used, it must be placed in an element that sets the itemscope
attribute. The value must be in the form of a URL.

spellcheck

Enables the spell checking of an element. The need for this attribute globally
may not be clear until you consider that all elements may be editable at
page view time with the contenteditable attribute.

tabindex

Defines the element-traversal order when the keyboard is used for navigation.

HTML5 Document Structure Changes

<header>
<h1>Welcome to the Future World of HTML5.</h1>
<h2>Don't be scared it isn't that hard!</h2>
</header>

Similarly, a footer element is provided for document authors to define the footer
content of a document, which often contains navigation, legal, and contact information:
<footer>
<p>Content of this example is not under copyright</p>
</footer>

The actual content to be placed in a <footer> tag is, of course, up to you and may be
enclosed in div, p, or other block elements, as illustrated by this simple example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>HTML5 header and footer example</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Some body content here.</p>
<p>Some more body content here.</p>
<footer>
<p>Content of this example is not under copyright.</p>
</footer>
</body>
</html>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/headerfooter.html
The HTML5 structural element with the most possible uses is the section element. A
particular <section> tag can be used to group arbitrary content together and may contain
further <section> tags to create the idea of subsections. Traditionally, we are familiar with
sections; just as this book is broken into chapters and various main and secondary sections,

PART I

As you have seen, the HTML5 document structure seems pretty much the same as in HTML
4 save a slightly different <!DOCTYPE> statement. However, if you look closer, there are a
few important differences in HTML5 that show the document structure has in fact been
expanded quite a bit.
HTML5 documents may contain a header element, which is used to set the header
section of a document and thus often contains the standard h1 to h6 heading elements:

Part I:

Core Markup

so too could a Web document be structured in this way. The example here illustrates the
basic use of HTML5 sections:
<section>
<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>New HTML5 elements.</p>
<section>
<h2>HTML5's section Element</h2>
<p>These elements are useful to create outlines.</p>
<section>
<h3>Nest Away!</h3>
<p>Nest your sections but as you nest you might want to indent.</p>
</section>
</section>
<p>Ok that's enough of that.</p>
</section>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/section.html
It may not be obvious but a section element may contain header and footer elements
of its own:
<section>
<header>
<h1>I am Section Heading</h1>
</header>
<h2>I am outside the section header I'm just a plain headline.</h2>
<p>Some more section content might go here.</p>
<footer>
<p>Hi from the footer of this section.</p>
</footer>
</section>

HTML5 uses headings and newly introduced elements like the section element for
outlining purposes. For example, the expanded example here shows a number of sections
with headers, footers, headlines, and content:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

Introducing HTML5

72

Part I:

Core Markup

HTML5–compliant browsers should take this markup and define an outline based upon
the use of headers, like so:

In theory, user agents could take the outlining semantics and derive meaning or even
provide an alternative browser interface, although that is quite speculative at this point. It is
clear, however, that if you introduce such outlining ideas, issues may arise. For example, the
first header really was not two levels of sectioning but simply one with a subhead. To
address this outlining, you would take this markup
<header>
<h1>Welcome to the Future World of HTML5</h1>
<h2>Don't be scared it isn't that hard!</h2>
</header>

and then join the subhead to the headline with an hgroup element like so:
<header>
<hgroup>
<h1>Welcome to the Future World of HTML5</h1>
<h2>Don't be scared it isn't that hard!</h2>
</hgroup>
</header>

No hgroup
elements used

hgroup
elements used

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/hgroup.html
Given these semantics, it is clear that HTML5 sectioning elements are not just a
formalization of <div> tags with appropriate class values. For example, you might
consider
<div class="header">
<!-- header here -->
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="header">
<h2>Section Heading</h2>
</div>
<p>Content of section.</p>
</div>
<div class="footer">
<!-- footer here -->
</div>

to be roughly the same as the previously introduced elements. To some degree this is true,
but clearly the names of the class values aren’t defined by a standard nor is any outlining
algorithm defined.
Beyond sectioning, HTML5 introduces a number of other structural elements. For
example, the article element is used to define a discrete unit of content such as a blog
post, comment, article, and so on. For example, the following defines a few individual blog
posts in a document:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>HTML5 article example</title>
</head>
<body>
<header>
<hgroup>
<h1>Welcome to the Future World of HTML5 Blog</h1>
<h2>Don't be scared it isn't that hard!</h2>
</hgroup>
</header>
<section id="articleList">
<h2>Latest Posts</h2>
<article id="article3">
<h2>HTML5 Here Today!</h2>
<p>Article content here...</p>
</article>

PART I

A complete example to explore can be found online, though you may find that a browser
does not do anything of interest and that you need an outline simulator to see the difference
between using <hgroup> tags or not.

</body>
</html>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/article.html
The idea of defining these discrete content units specially is that you might wish to
extract them automatically, so again, having defined elements as opposed to some ad hoc
use of class names on <div> tags is preferred.

NOTE Under early HTML5 drafts, the article element provided for cite and pubdate

attributes, which may make the usage of the content more meaningful by outside sites; however,
these were later dropped and use of <time> tags was encouraged.

HTML5 also introduces an aside element, which may be used within content to
represent material that is tangential or, as the element name suggests, an aside:
<p>Here we explore the various HTML5 elements. I would write
some real content here but you are busy reading the book anyway.
</p>
<aside>
<h2>Pointless Aside</h2>
<p>Oh by the way did you know that the author lives in San Diego?

remember to stay focused as there is much to learn.
</p>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/aside.html

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

NOTE If a heading is not provided in an aside, you may see an outline mechanism add “Untitled
Section” or potentially even make up one based upon the start of the element content.

Adding Semantics
Many of the elements that HTML5 adds that can be used right away are semantic in nature.
In this sense, HTML5 continues the appropriate goal of separating structure from style. In
this section, you will see a number of repurposed elements as well as some that are all new.
At first you won’t see much value in using them other than to add semantics, but toward
the end of the chapter we will explore how to make the elements understandable to most
modern browsers and how to apply some simple styling for end users.

Marking Text
The new HTML5 element mark was introduced for highlighting content similarly to how
a highlighter pen might be used on important text in a book. The following example wraps
a few important words:
<p>Here comes <mark>marked text</mark> was it obvious?</p>

Unfortunately, you won’t necessarily see anything with such an example:

You would need to apply a style. Here, inline styles are used just to show the idea:
<p>The new HTML5 specification is in the works. While <mark
style="background-color: red;">many features are not currently
implemented or even well defined</mark> yet, <mark
style="background-color: green;">progress is being made</mark>.
Stay tuned to see more new HTML elements added to your Web documents
in the years to come.</p>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/mark.html

PART I

You may have noted that an <h2> tag was used in the aside. While not required, it is
useful as a reminder to readers that aside elements serve as outline sectioning elements, as
shown here:

75

76

Part I:

Core Markup

After seeing such an example, you might wonder what the point is of this element,
because a <span> tag or maybe even an <em> tag could be used instead. Again, semantics is
the key to this element. It makes the meaning of HTML documents more obvious.

Indicating Dates and Time
Another semantic inline element, time, was introduced by HTML5 to indicate content that
is a date, time, or both. For example,
<p>Today it is <time>2009-07-08</time> which is an interesting date.</p>

as well as
<p>An interesting date/time for SciFi buffs is <time>1999-09-13T09:15:00
</time>!</p>

would both be valid. The element should contain a date/time value that is in the format
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD, where the letters correspond to years, months, days, hours,
minutes, and seconds, T is the actual letter ‘T,’ and ZD represents a time zone designator of
either Z or a value like +hh:mm to indicate a time zone offset. However, it seems reasonable
that the time element would contain values that may not be in a common format but are
recognized by humans as dates. If you try something like
<p>Right now it is <time>6:15</time>.</p>

it may be meaningful to you but it does not conform to HTML5. To provide both humanand machine-friendly date/time content, the element supports a datetime attribute, which
should be set to the previously mentioned date format of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD. So,
the following example is meaningful because it provides both a readable form and a
machine-understood value:
<p>My first son was born on <time datetime="2006-01-13">Friday the 13th
</time> so it is my new lucky day.</p>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/time.html
Similar to mark, the time element has no predefined rendering, though you could
certainly define a look using CSS.

Inserting Figures
It is often necessary to include images, graphs, compound objects that contain text and
images, and so on in our Web documents, all of which usually are called figures. Long ago,
HTML 3 tried to introduce the fig element to represent such constructs; HTML5
reintroduces the idea with the more appropriately named figure element. A simple
example illustrates this new element’s usage:
<figure id="fig1">
<dd>
<img src="figure.png" height="100" width="100"

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/figure.html
Acting as a semantic element, figure simply groups items within an enclosed <dd>
tag, though it may associate them with a caption defined by a <dt> tag as shown in the
example. You may desire to style a <figure> tag by placing a stroke around its visual
rendering or display it in some other appropriate manner; of course, that is the duty of CSS.
You should also note that the use of id on a <figure> will likely be useful to target using
links, as figures may be positioned away from the content that references them.

NOTE In early drafts of the HTML5 specification, the <legend> was used instead of <dt> and no
special tag was required for content enclosure.

Specifying Navigation
One new HTML5 element that is long overdue is the nav element. The purpose of this
element is to encapsulate a group of links that serves as a collection of offsite links,
document navigation, or site navigation:
<nav>
<h2>Offsite Links</h2>
<a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a><br>
<a href="http://www.htmlref.com">Book site</a><br>
<a href="http://www.pint.com">Author's Firm</a><br>
</nav>

Conventionally, many Web developers have used <ul> and <li> tags to encapsulate
navigation and then styled the elements appropriately as menu items. This seems to
introduce quite a bit of ambiguity in markup because it may be difficult to determine the
difference between a list that has links in it and a list that is simply navigation. The
semantics defined by HTML5 for a <nav> tag eliminate this confusion. Interestingly, there is
no requirement to avoid using <ul> and <li> tags within navigation, so if you are a CSS
aficionado who is comfortable with that approach, it is fine to use markup like this:
<nav id="mainNav">
<ul>
<li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
<li><a href="services.html">Services</a></li>
<li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
</ul>
</nav>

HTML5’s Open Media Effort
An interesting aspect of HTML5 that is reminiscent of the previous efforts of Netscape and
Microsoft is the support for tag-based multimedia in HTML documents. Traditionally,
multimedia has been inserted with the embed and object elements, particularly when
inserting Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime, Windows Media, and other formats. However,
there was a time when tags specifically to insert media were supported; interestingly, some
of those features, such as the dynsrc attribute for <img> tags, lived on until just recently.
HTML5 brings this concept of tag-based multimedia back.

<video>
To insert video, use a <video> tag and set its src attribute to a local or remote URL containing
a playable movie. You should also display playblack controls by including the controls
attribute, as well as set the dimensions of the movie to its natural size. This simple demo shows
the use of the new element:
<video src="http://htmlref.com/ch2/html_5.mp4"
width="640" height="360" controls>
<strong>HTML5 video element not supported</strong>
</video>

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

79

NOTE If you are using XHTML5, given that controls is an occurrence style attribute, use
controls="controls" to be conforming.

However, even if a browser supports the video element, it might still have problems
displaying the video. For example, Firefox 3.5 won’t load this particular media format directly:

HTML5 open video has, as it currently stands, brought back the madness of media
codec support that Flash solved, albeit in a less than stellar way. To address the media
support problem, you need to add in alternative formats to use by including a number of
<source> tags:
<video width="640"

height="360" controls poster="loading.png">

<source src="html_5.mp4" type="video/mp4">
<source src="html_5.ogv" type="video/ogg">
<strong>HTML5 video element not supported</strong>
</video>

PART I

You should note the included content in the tag that nonsupporting browsers fall back
to. The following shows Internet Explorer displaying the alternative content:

80

Part I:

Core Markup

Also note in the preceding snippet the use of the poster attribute, which is set to display an
image in place of the linked object in case it takes a few moments to load. Other video element–
specific attributes like autobuffer can be used to advise the browser to download media
content in the background to improve playback, and autoplay, which when set, will start the
media as soon as it can. A complete example of the video element in action is shown here:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>HTML5 video example</title>

<strong>HTML5 video element not supported</strong>
</video>
</body>
</html>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/video.html
The reference section in Chapter 3 shows the complete list of attributes for the video
element supported as of late 2009. Be warned, though, that if the various media markup
efforts of the late 1990s repeat themselves, it is quite likely that there will be an explosion of
attributes, many of which may be specific to a particular browser or media format.

<audio>
HTML5’s audio element is quite similar to the video element. The element should support
common sound formats such as WAV files:
<audio src="http://htmlref.com/ch2/music.wav"></audio>

In this manner, the audio element looks pretty much the same as Internet Explorer’s
proprietary bgsound element. Having the fallback content rely on that proprietary tag
might not be a bad idea:
<audio>
<bgsound src="http://htmlref.com/ch2/music.wav">
</audio>

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

<audio src="http://htmlref.com/ch2/music.wav" controls></audio>

As with the video element, you also have autobuffer and autoplay attributes for the
audio element. Unfortunately, just like video, there are also audio format support issues,
so you may want to specify different formats using <source> tags:
<audio controls autobuffer autoplay>
<source src="http://htmlref.com/ch2/music.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
<source src="http://htmlref.com/ch2/music.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>

Media Considerations
An interesting concern about “open” media formats is whether or not they really are open.
As the HTML5 specification emerges, fissures are already forming in terms of how these
elements are implemented, what codecs will be supported by what browser vendors, and
whether HTML5 will require a particular codec to be supported by all HTML5–compliant
browsers. Valid concerns about so-called “submarine” patents surfacing and torpedoing the
open media effort are real and hotly debated.
Unfortunately, given this media codec chaos, at the time of this edition’s writing, getting
an example to work in all browsers can be quite a chore and Flash and/or QuickTime support
must be added to address older browsers. Simply put, for all its possibilities, so far HTML5
media is a messy solution at best. The following adds in a fallback within the previous video
example for Flash:
<video width="640" height="360" controls poster="loading.png">
<source src="http://htmlref.com/ch2/html_5.mp4" type="video/mp4">
<source src="http://htmlref.com/ch2/html_5.ogv" type="video/ogg">
<object data="html_5.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
width="640" height="360" id="player">
<param name="movie" value="html_5.swf"/>
<strong>Error: No video support at all</strong>
</object>
</video>

Given the example, I think it isn’t much of a stretch to imagine a <source> tag being set to
a Flash type eventually; making the direction this is going even more confusing.
So while the potential benefits of open media formats can be debated endlessly, there is
also the pragmatic concern of how long it will take before HTML5’s open media movement
becomes viable. Getting to the stable media playback world provided by Flash took many
years, and it seems unlikely that HTML5 solutions will move much faster.

NOTE The current state of the HTML5 specification before press suggests that no codec is official.

While the neutrality is welcome, the reality that implementations vary considerably still continues.

Client-Side Graphics with <canvas>
The canvas element is used to render simple graphics such as line art, graphs, and other custom
graphical elements on the client side. Initially introduced in the summer of 2004 by Apple in its
Safari browser, the canvas element is now supported in many browsers, including Firefox 1.5+,
Opera 9+, and Safari 2+, and as such is included in the HTML5 specification. While Internet
Explorer does not directly support the tag as of yet, there are JavaScript libraries3 that emulate
<canvas> syntax using Microsoft’s Vector Markup Language (VML).
From a markup point of view, there is little that you can do with a <canvas> tag. You
simply put the element in the page, name it with an id attribute, and define its dimensions
with height and width attributes:

Circa late 2009, the most popular IE <canvas> emulation library is explorercanvas, available at http://
code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/.

var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
var context = canvas.getContext("2d");

NOTE 3D drawing is coming to <canvas> but is not currently defined outside of extensions.
Once you have the drawing context, you might employ various methods to draw on it.
For example, the strokeRect(x,y,width,height) method takes x and y coordinates and
height and width, all specified as numbers representing pixels. For example,
context.strokeRect(10,10,150,50);

would draw a simple rectangle of 150 pixels by 50 pixels starting at the coordinate 10,10
from the origin of the placed <canvas> tag. If you wanted to set a particular color for the
stroke, you might set it with the strokeStyle() method, like so:
context.strokeStyle = "blue";
context.strokeRect(10,10,150,50);

Similarly, you can use the fillRect(x,y,width,height) method to make a rectangle,
but this time in a solid manner:
context.fillRect(150,30,75,75);

By default, the fill color will be black, but you can define a different fill color by using
the fillColor() method. As a demonstration this example sets a light red color:
context.fillStyle = "rgb(218,0,0)";

You can use standard CSS color functions, which may include opacity; for example, here
the opacity of the reddish fill is set to 40 percent:
context.fillStyle = "rgba(218,112,214,0.4)";

A full example using the first canvas element and associated JavaScript is presented here:

Note the alternative content placed within the element for browsers that don’t support
the element.
After you place a <canvas> tag in a document, your next step is to use JavaScript to
access and draw on the element. For example, the following fetches the object by its id
value and creates a two-dimensional drawing context:

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/canvasie.html

Drawing and Styling Lines and Shapes
HTML5 defines a complete API for drawing on a canvas element, which is composed of
many individual sub-APIs for common tasks. For example, to do some more complex
shapes, the path API must be used. The path API stores a collection of subpaths formed by
various shape functions and connects the subpaths via a fill() or stroke() call. To begin
a path, context.beginPath() is called to reset the path collection. Then, any variety of
shape calls can occur to add a subpath to the collection. Once all subpaths are properly
added, context.closePath() can optionally be called to close the loop. Then fill() or
stroke() will also display the path as a newly created shape. This simple example draws
a V shape using lineTo():
context.beginPath();
context.lineTo(20,100);
context.lineTo(120,300);
context.lineTo(220,100);
context.stroke();

Now, if you were to add context.closePath()before context.stroke(), the V
shape would turn into a triangle, because closePath() would connect the last point and
the first point.
Also, by calling fill() instead of stroke(), the triangle will be filled in with whatever
the fill color is, or black if none is specified. Of course, you can call both fill() and
stroke() on any drawn shape if you want to have a stroke around a filled region. Thus, to

86

Part I:

Core Markup

style the drawing, you can specify the fillStyle and strokeStyle and maybe even
define the width of the line using lineWidth, as shown in this example:
context.strokeStyle = "blue";
context.fillStyle = "red";
context.lineWidth = 10;
context.beginPath();
context.lineTo(200,10);
context.lineTo(200,50);
context.lineTo(380,10);
context.closePath();
context.stroke();
context.fill();

As you saw in a few previous examples, you can change color by setting the fillColor
property. In addition to the CSS color values, you can also set the fillColor to a gradient
object. A gradient object can be created by using createLinearGradient() or
createRadialGradient().
The following example creates a simple linear gradient that will be applied to a rectangle
using the createLinearGradient(x1,y1,x2,y2) method. The gradient is positioned at
10,150 and is set to go 200 pixels in both directions.
var lg = context.createLinearGradient(10,150,200,200);

Next, the gradient colors are added using the addColorStop() method. This specifies
a color and the offset position in the gradient where the color should occur. The offset must
be between 0 and 1.
lg.addColorStop(0,"#B03060");
lg.addColorStop(0.75,"#4169E1");
lg.addColorStop(1,"#FFE4E1");

Of course, you could use the rgba CSS function to create a gradient with transparency
as well. Finally, the fillColor is set to the gradient. Here is the complete code snippet,
followed by a visual example:
var lg = context.createLinearGradient(10,150,200,200);
lg.addColorStop(0,"#B03060");
lg.addColorStop(0.5,"#4169E1");
lg.addColorStop(1,"#FFE4E1");
context.fillStyle = lg;
context.beginPath();
context.rect(10,150,200,200);
context.fill();

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

87

PART I

Note that before you draw the shape, you reset the path to ensure that you do not apply
these changes to previously rendered parts of the drawing.
To create a radial gradient using createRadialGradient(x1,y1,r1,x2,y2,r2), you
must set the position and radius of two circles to serve as the gradient. You add color stops
in the same manner as the linear gradient, so the code looks quite similar otherwise:
var rg = context.createRadialGradient(350,300,80,360,250,80);
rg.addColorStop(0,"#A7D30C");
rg.addColorStop(0.9,"#019F62");
rg.addColorStop(1,"rgba(1,159,98,0) ");
context.fillStyle = rg;
context.beginPath();
context.fillRect(250,150,200,200);

Applying Some Perspective

As the context is specified as 2d, it is no surprise that everything you have seen so far has
been two-dimensional. It is possible to add some perspective by choosing proper points and
shades. The 3D cube shown in Figure 2-3 is created using nothing more than several
moveTo() and lineTo() calls. The lineTo() call is used to create three sides of the cube,
but the points set are not straight horizontal and vertical lines as we see when we make 2D
squares. Shading is applied to give the illusion of dimensionality because of the application
of a light source. While the code here is pretty simple, you can see that using canvas

Drawing Arcs and Curves
Drawing on canvas isn’t limited to simple lines; it is also possible to create curved lines
using arc(), arcTo(), quadraticCurveTo(), and bezierCurveTo(). To illustrate these
methods, this section shows how to draw a simple face.
You can use the arc(x,y,radius,startAngle,endAngle,counterclockwise)
method to draw circles and parts of circles. Its location is defined by the point of its center

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

context.arc(150,150,100,0,Math.PI*2,true);

Use the quadraticCurveTo(cpx,cpy,x,y) method to draw the nose and the mouth.
This function starts at the last point in the path and draws a line to (x,y). The control point
(cpx,cpy) is used to pull the line in that direction, resulting in a curved line. However, you
call moveTo() first to set the last point in the path. In the following snippet, a line was
drawn from (155,130) to (155,155). Because the x-coordinate of the control point (130,145)
is to the left, the line is pulled in that direction. Because the y-coordinate is in between the
y-coordinates, the pull is roughly in the middle.
context.moveTo(155,130);
context.quadraticCurveTo(130,145,155,155);
context.moveTo(100,175);
context.quadraticCurveTo(150,250,200,175);

You call bezierCurveTo(cp1x,cp1y,cp2x,cp2y,x,y) to draw the eyes. This function
is similar to quadraticCurveTo() except that it has two control points and has a line that is
pulled toward both of them. Again, moveTo() is used to set the start point of the line:
context.moveTo(80,110);
context.bezierCurveTo(95,85,115,85,130,110);
context.moveTo(170,110);
context.bezierCurveTo(185,85,205,85,220,110);

Lastly, use arcTo(x1,y1,x2,y2,radius) to draw a frame around the face. Unfortunately,
foreshadowing some issues with the canvas API, we note that arcTo() is not currently
supported properly in all browsers, so it may render oddly. When it does work, it creates
two lines and then draws an arc with the radius specified and containing a point tangent to
each of the lines. The first line is drawn from the last point in the subpath to (x1,y1) and
the second line is drawn from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).
context.moveTo(50,20);
context.arcTo(280,20,280,280,30);
context.arcTo(280,280,20,280,30);
context.arcTo(20,280,20,20,30);
context.arcTo(20,20,280,20,30);

The complete example is shown next. Note that, given layering, you draw and fill the
frame and face and then draw the features last. Also note that you reset the paths with the
beginPath() method. Commonly, people forget to do this, which can produce some
interesting drawings. A rendering of the face example is shown in Figure 2-4.

PART I

(x,y) as well as the circle’s radius. How much of the circle is drawn is defined by
startAngle and endAngle, in radians. The direction of the curve is set by a Boolean value,
which is the final parameter specified by counterclockwise. If it is set to true, the curve
will move counterclockwise; otherwise, it will move clockwise. If your math is a bit rusty, to
make a full circle, the start angle should be set to 0 and the end angle should be 2π. So to
start your face drawing, use arc() to draw the head as a circle:

Scaling, Rotating, and Translating Drawings
You now have looked at the basic shapes and styling, but there is much more that you can
do to customize a drawing through transformations. The canvas API provides a number of
useful methods that accomplish the common tasks you will likely want to perform. First
let’s explore the scale(x,y) function, which can be used to scale objects. The x parameter
shows how much to scale in the horizontal direction and the y parameter indicates how
much to scale vertically.
/* scale tall and thin */
context.scale(.5,1.5);
writeBoxes(context);
/* move short and wide */
context.scale(1.75,.2);
writeBoxes(context);

Next up is the rotate(angle) method, which can be used to rotate a drawing in a
clockwise direction by an angle defined in radians:
/* rotate to the right */
context.rotate(Math.PI/8);
writeBoxes(context);
/* rotate to the left */
context.rotate(-Math.PI/8);
writeBoxes(context);

context.translate(100,100);
context.fillRect(0,0,100,100);

A simple example of moving some boxes around is shown here:

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/canvastranslate.html
All the methods presented so far are conveniences to help us use an underlying
transform matrix associated with paths. All paths have an identity matrix as their default
transform. As an identity, this transform matrix does nothing, but it is certainly possible to
adjust this matrix in a few ways. First, it can be directly modified by calling setTransform
(m11,m12,m21,m22,dx,dy), which resets the matrix to the identity matrix and then
calls transform() with the given parameters. Or you can do this directly by using
transform(m11,m12,m21,m22,dx,dy), which multiplies whatever the current matrix is
with the matrix defined by
m11
m12
0

m21
m22
0

dx
dy
1

The problem with the method should be obvious: unless you understand more than a
bit about matrix math, this can be a bit daunting to use. On the bright side, with the
method, you can do just about anything you want. Here a simple example skews and
moves some simple rectangles. The result is shown in Figure 2-5.

PART I

The translate(x,y) function is a handy function to use to change the origin from
(0,0) to another location in the drawing. The following example moves the origin to
(100,100). Then, when the start coordinates of the rectangle are specified at (0,0), it really
starts at (100,100).

Using Bitmaps in Drawings
A very interesting feature of canvas is the ability to insert images into the drawing There
are several ways to do this, but let’s start with the most basic, drawImage(img,x,y), which
takes an image object and the coordinates for where the image should be placed. The image
will be its natural size when called in this manner. You can use drawImage(img,x,y,w,h)
if you need to modify the image size and set the width and height.
The actual image passed in to the drawImage() method can come from a few places.
It can be
• An image already loaded on the page
• Dynamically created through the DOM
• Another canvas object
• An image created by setting its src to a data: URL
The important thing to remember is that the image must be loaded by the time canvas
is ready to access it. This may require use of the onload function for the image:
var img = new Image();
img.onload = function(){
context.drawImage(img,0,0,400,400);
}
img.src = "dog.jpg";

The last way that drawImage(img,sx,sy,sw,sh,dx,dy,dw,dh) may be called allows
a part of the image to be cut out and drawn to the canvas. The (sx,sy) coordinates are the
location on the image, and sw and sh are the width and height, respectively. The rest of the
parameters prefixed with d are the same as in the previous form of the method.
var img = document.getElementById("image1");
/* slices a 100px square from image1 at location (200,75)
Places on the canvas at (50,50) and stretches it to 300px square. */
context.drawImage(img,200,75,100,100,50,50,300,300);

Text Support for canvas
In browsers that supported early forms of the canvas element, text was not well supported
in a drawing, if at all. Per HTML5, text functions should now be supported by the canvas
API, and several browsers already do support it. You can write text by using fillText
(text,x,y [,maxWidth]) or strokeText(text,x,y [,maxWidth]). Both functions
take an optional last parameter, maxWidth, that will cut the text off if the width is longer
than specified. Often, both fillText() and strokeText() will be utilized to display an
outline around the text. Here we set a fill color of blue and then write the phrase “Canvas is
great!” with a black stroke around the letters.

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

To get more-customized text, you can use the font property, which you set identically
to a CSS font property. You can use textAlign and textBaseline to set the horizontal
and vertical alignment of the text string. The textAlign property has the possible values of
start, end, left, right, and center. The textBaseline property can be set to top,
hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic, and bottom.
context.font = "bold 30px sans-serif";
context.textAlign = "center";
context.textBaseline = "middle";

You can add shadows to shapes simply by setting the shadow properties, shadowOffsetX,
shadowOffsetY, shadowBlur, and shadowColor. The offsets simply set how far the shadow

should be offset from the image. A positive number would make the shadow go to the right
and down. A negative number would make it go to the left and up. The shadowBlur property
indicates how blurred the shadow will be, and the shadowColor property indicates the color.
This code fragment demonstrates setting a shadow.
context.shadowOffsetX = 10;
context.shadowOffsetY = 5;
context.shadowColor = "rgba(255,48,48,0.5)";
context.shadowBlur = 5;
context.fillStyle = "red";
context.fillRect(100,100,100,100);

All the concepts from this and the last section can be put together as follows to caption
an image with some shadowed text, as shown in Figure 2-6.

Introducing HTML5

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/canvastext.html
We have just scratched the surface of the canvas API. A full listing of the API can be found
in the reference in Chapter 3. However, a reference is simply that; be warned that the use of
the canvas element can get quite involved, and you should not reasonably expect to use it
if you don’t have significant JavaScript knowledge. Even if you know JavaScript, there are
challenges ahead because implementations vary between browsers and, for now, Internet
Explorer requires a compatibility library even for basic support. Scripting canvas-based
drawings for interactivity is a bit clunky, and text support is far from stellar. Accessibility
concerns also abound. However, don’t let the challenges dissuade you; HTML5’s canvas
API is quite powerful and warrants your exploration. The purpose of this section was to
introduce you to the element and show you what is possible to accomplish with it. Consult
the Web for the latest changes in canvas support.

HTML5 Form Changes
Besides starting the HTML5 specification, the Web Hypertext Application Technology
Working Group (WHATWG) has been busy over the years considering the future of the
Web and went so far as to develop a specification called Web Forms that aimed to bring
HTML forms into the modern age. The specification added a number of form widgets,
validation facilities, and some accessibility improvements. Few browsers save Opera
implemented any of these features, and some in the industry complained about the
complexity of the specification. However, most of the Web Forms specification has been
incorporated into HTML5 and more and more of its features are now being implemented
in browsers. In this section we take a quick tour of these exciting features but place more of
a focus on what is already being implemented in current browsers.

New Form Field Types
Traditionally, the HTML input element is used to define most form fields. The particular
type of form field of interest is defined with the type attribute, which is set to text,
password, hidden, checkbox, radio, submit, reset, image, or button. HTML5 adds
quite a number of other values, which we will briefly explore here.
First, setting the type equal to color should create a color picker:
<p><label>color:<input type="color" name="favColor"></label></p>

As of the time of this edition’s writing, no implementation existed for this control, but it
might look something like this:

PART I

<canvas> Conclusions

102

Part I:

Core Markup

A variety of date controls can now be directly created by setting the type attribute to
date, datetime, datetime-local, month, week, or time. Several of these controls are
demonstrated here:

<p><label>date:
<input type="date" name="date">
</label></p>
<p><label>datetime:
<input type="datetime" name="datetime">
</label></p>
<p><label>datetime-local:
<input type="datetime-local" name="datetime2">
</label></p>
<p><label>time:
<input type="time" name="time">
</label></p>
<p><label>month:
<input type="month" name="month">
</label></p>
<p><label>week:
<input type="week" name="week">
</label></p>

It should be possible to restrict the dates chosen, but currently any restrictions must be
controlled with script.

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

103

Setting type to number gives you a numeric spin box in conforming browsers:
<p><label>number:<input type="number" name="number"></label></p>

PART I

When unconstrained, the spin box will be able to move up and down arbitrarily with no
limits. However, it is possible to define allowed values. For example, the max attribute can
be set to limit the maximum value, min to limit the smallest value, and even step to
indicate how values may be modified. For example,
<input type="number" name="number2" min="-5" max="25" step="5">

would create a numeric spin box that ranges from –5 to 25 in increments of 5.
A similar form of control can be created using a range control:
<input type="range" name="range" max="100" min="1" step="5">

This control presents itself as a slider, which so far has a varied appearance in browsers:

Like the number picker, the min, max, and step attributes all can be set to limit values:
<p><label>range (1-100 step 5):
<input type="range" name="range" max="100" min="1" step="5">
</label></p>
<p><label>range (-1000-1000 step 100):
<input type="range" name="range" max="1000" min="-1000" step="100">
</label></p>

It is also possible to further define semantic restrictions by setting an <input> tag’s

type attribute to tel, email, or url:

<p><label>Telephone Number: <input type="tel" name="telno"></label></p>
<p><label>Email: <input type="email" name="email"></label></p>
<p><label>URL: <input type="url" name="url"></label></p>

A browser may then specify some indications of the appropriate data type:

104

Part I:

Core Markup

It is also possible to set type to search, which may eventually have an associated pick
list. Currently, some browsers provide some controls for clearing a search field:

Validating Data Entry
We have already seen a number of HTML5 changes that allow us to restrict the type of data
entered into a form. It is also possible to force the user to enter data, without resorting to
JavaScript, in an HTML5–compliant browser by setting the required attribute for a form
control:
<input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname" required>

A browser may then set an error style on the field and present a message if there is a
problem:

The pattern attribute also can be employed to force the entered data to conform to a
supplied regular expression:
<label for="phonenum" class="required">Phone Number:</label>
<input type="text" name="phonenum" id="phonenum" required
pattern="^\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}$">

If a title is specified when patterns are applied, the browser may display this advisory
information:
<label for="phonenum" class="required">Phone Number:</label>
<input type="text" name="phonenum" id="phonenum" required
pattern="^\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}$"
title="Phone number of form (xxx) xxx-xxxx required">

However, in some cases, you can not only apply a pattern but also employ the
appropriate semantic type value like email, though it isn’t clear if these elements will apply
their own implied validation pattern matches simply by setting them as required:

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

The specification indicates that the presentation of fields in error can be controlled by
using the CSS pseudo-class :invalid in HTML5–compliant browsers.
A full example for you to test out basic HTML5 required and pattern usage in a
browser can be found at the book’s support Web site.

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/requiredpattern.html
NOTE Because validation is under browser control, HTML5 provides a formnovalidate
attribute that can be set on controls or the form to disable validation.

Autocomplete Lists
Under HTML5, the input element’s list attribute is used to set the DOM id of a
datalist element used to provide a predefined list of options suggested to the user for
entry:
<p><label>Favorite Dog: <input type="text" list="dogs"></label></p>
<datalist id="dogs">
<option>Angus</option>
<option>Tucker</option>
<option>Cisco</option>
<option>Sabrina</option>
</datalist>

This is similar to the autocomplete attribute discussed in the next section, but it allows
you to specify the default data rather than relying on what may have been entered in the
browser previously.

Miscellaneous Usability Improvements
Commonly, Web page authors use the value attribute to populate some text in a form field:
<input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname" value="Thomas">

Quite often, people put placeholder or advisory text here, like so:
<input type="text" name="middlename" id="middlename"
value="Enter your middle name here">

PART I

<label for="email" class="required">E-mail:</label>
<input type="text" name="email" id="email" required
pattern="^\w+([\.-]?\w+)*@\w+([\.-]?\w+)*\.(\w{2}|(com|net|org|edu|i
nt|mil|gov|arpa|biz|aero|name|coop|info|pro|museum))$" title="E-mail format
required">

105

106

Part I:

Core Markup

However, using the value attribute in this manner is somewhat inappropriate, because the
purpose of the attribute is not to supply instructions for the field’s use but rather to supply
a potential value for the user to submit to the server. HTML5 introduces the placeholder
attribute to use instead for this duty:
<input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname"
placeholder="Enter your name here">

HTML5 also introduces the autofocus attribute, which when placed on a field should
cause a supporting browser to immediately focus this field once the page is loaded:
<label>Search:<input type="search" name="query"
id="searchBox" autofocus></label>

Also under HTML5, it should be possible to advise the browser to display the

autocomplete suggestions provided for fields if similar field names have been used in the

past:

<input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname"
placeholder="Enter your name here" autocomplete>

Interestingly, this particular attribute has been supported in Internet Explorer browsers for
some time.
Other form improvements likely will be added to the HTML5 specification. The aim
here is to give you a sense of the changes the HTML5 specification intends to bring to
Web-based data collection.

Emerging Elements and Attributes to Support Web Applications
A key theme of the HTML5 specification is the emphasis on supporting Web applications.
A number of elements and attributes have been introduced in the specification to continue
the migration from Web pages to Web applications. However, most of these features are not
implemented in browsers, and some are controversial enough that their inclusion in later
versions of the specification is far from certain. Thus, you are warned that the elements
presented here should be considered only illustrative of the kinds of changes HTML5 tends
to encourage and that some of them may be changed or removed. As of yet, no native
implementation of these elements exists, so we simulated their possible renderings using
a JavaScript library. Given the speculative nature of these new elements, you should consult
the specification for the latest information on support.

menu Element Repurposed
One element that will be implemented in browsers but might not perform the actions defined
in HTML5 is the menu element. Traditionally, this element was supposed to be used to create
a simple menu for choices, but most browsers simply rendered it as an unordered list:
<menu type="list" id="oldStyle">
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

107

<li>Item 3</li>
<li>Item 4</li>
</menu>

PART I

Under HTML5 the menu element has been returned to its original purpose. A new
attribute, type, is introduced that takes a value of toolbar, context, or list (the default).
This example sets up a simple File menu for a Web application:
<menu type="toolbar" id="fileMenu" label="File">
<li><a href="javascript:newItem();">New</a></li>
<li><a href="javascript:openItem();">Open</a></li>
<li><a href="javascript:closeItem();">Close</a></li>
<hr>
<li><a href="javascript:saveItem();">Save</a></li>
<li><a href="javascript:saveAsItem();">Save as...</a></li>
<hr>
<li><a href="javascript:exitApp();">Exit</a></li>
</menu>

Using CSS and JavaScript, this menu might render like so:

Again, this is completely speculative and is just meant to illustrate a possibility.
With menu, it would also be possible to define a context menu, usually invoked by a
right-click:
<menu type="context" id="simpleMenu">
<li><a href="javascript:add();">Add</a></li>
<li><a href="javascript:edit();">Edit</a></li>
<li><a href="javascript:delete();">Delete</a></li>
</menu>

This could render something like this:

108

Part I:

Core Markup

The global contextmenu attribute is used to define an element’s context menu, which is
generally the menu invoked upon a right-click. The attribute’s value should hold a string
that references the id of a <menu> tag found in the DOM. For example,
<div contextmenu="simpleMenu">Widget</div>

would reference the previously defined menu via a right-click. If there is no element found
or no value, then the element has no special context menu and the user agent should show
its default menu. Internet Explorer and many other browsers support an oncontextmenu
attribute that could be used to implement the idea of this emerging attribute.
Again, all of this is completely speculative and meant to illustrate the concept; so far, no
browser natively implements this functionality, though it wouldn’t be a stretch to have
JavaScript emulate this.

command Element
The menu element may contain not just links but also other interactive items, including the
newly introduced command element. This empty element takes a label and may have
an icon decoration as well. The command element has a type attribute, which may be set
to command, radio, or checkbox, though when radio is employed there needs to be
a radiogroup indication. A simple example here with the repurposed menu element should
illustrate the possible use of this element:
<menu type="command" label="Main Menu">
<command type="command" label="Add" icon="add.png">
<command type="command" label="Edit" icon="edit.png">
<command type="command" label="Delete" icon="delete.png">
<hr>
<menu type="command" label="Skin" id="skinMenu">
<command type="radio" radiogroup="skin" label="Classic">
<command type="radio" radiogroup="skin" label="Modern" checked>
<command type="radio" radiogroup="skin" label="Neo">
</menu>
<hr>
<command type="checkbox" label="Secure Mode">
</menu>

Such a menu might look like the following:

But again, this is just illustrative and in this case, I am somewhat skeptical about the

command element because it seems to share many of the aspects of traditional form field

controls, so why more elements are needed is unclear.

meter and progress Elements

<p>Warp Drive Output: <meter min="0" max="10" low="3" optimum="7" high="9"
value="9.5" title="Captain she can't take much more of this!"></meter></p>

A potential rendering could look like

More likely, it will look like a simple meter, but this speculation does illustrate just how
variable presentation may be. Using script, it is probably possible to simulate this element
right now even though browsers don’t support it.
Slightly different from meter is the progress element, which defines completion
progress for some task. Commonly, this element might represent the percentage from
0 percent to 100 percent of a task, such as loading to be completed:
<p>Progress: <progress id="progressBar" max="100.00" value="33.1">
33.1%</progress></p>

Of course, the range and values provided here are purely arbitrary and the rendering
shown is similarly just illustrative of the idea of the progress element.

details Element
The new details element is supposed to represent some form of extra details, such as
a tooltip or revealed region that may be shown to a user. The details element can contain
one dt element to specify the summary of the details as well as one dd element to supply
the actual details.The attribute open can be set to reveal the details or can be changed
dynamically, as shown in this example:
<details onclick="this.open='open'">
<dt>Help?</dt>
<dd>This could give you help with HTML5 but we need more
implementations to prove how things will work.</dd>
</details>

PART I

Two fairly similar elements have been introduced in HTML5 to show current status. First,
the meter element defines a scalar measurement within a known range, similar to what
might be represented by a gauge. The following example is a reading of velocity for some
fantastically fast space vessel:

110

Part I:

Core Markup

Here is an example of how the details element might appear:

output Element
The final stop on this speculative tour is the output element, which is used to define a
region that will be used as output from some calculation or form control. Here I imagine
using the calendar picker and having the eventual release date of HTML5 being revealed in
an output element:
<form action="#" method="get" id="testform">
<p><input type="date" id="year">
<p>HTML5 released in the year
<output for="year">&nbsp;</output></p>
</form>

Script could certainly be used to perform this action:

In this case, it is doubtful we need to concern ourselves too much with the likely
representation of this yet-to-be supported element, because, as defined, output is just
a semantic element and could be simulated in traditional HTML using a <div>.

The Uncertain Future of Frames
The introduction of frames with Netscape 2 heralded some of the first markup changes to
support Web applications. Interestingly, the HTML5 specification drops <frameset>,
<frame>, and <noframes> because “their usage affected usability and accessibility for the
end user in a negative way4.” Despite dropping it from support, the specification does still
offer rendering rules for the frame and frameset elements. This is more evidence that the
HTML5 specification tries to account for anything a Web developer may design even if it is
not according to the specification.
Given the fairly widespread use of frames, some online pundits have suggested that this
frame elimination can be worked around by using an HTML 4 frameset to pull in HTML5
documents. In this spirit, we may validate all around but not really address the concerns of
the W3C and others. It would seem from these possible changes from HTML5 that the days
of frames are numbered, or are they?
HTML5 continues to support <iframe>; in fact, it not only supports it but extends the
tag. The inline frame has plenty of life left if the HTML5 vision comes true because it will be
used to include new content and functionality in pages from remote sources and may even
be used in intra-document communication. So, the future of frames as far as HTML5 is
concerned isn’t set.

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

<iframe src="content.html" name="thisframe" width="200"
height="300" seamless">[alternate content]</iframe>

Here is the same example using XHTML style syntax:
<iframe src="content.htm" name="thisframe" width="200"
height="300" seamless="seamless">[alternate content]</iframe>

The sandbox attribute “sandboxes” the iframe, essentially preventing it from pulling in
content from any source other than the iframe itself. Used without attributes, sandbox has
the following effects on the iframe:
• New windows cannot be created from within the iframe.
• Plug-ins are prohibited; embed, object, and applet will not function in
a sandboxed iframe.
• Nested inline frames are prohibited.
• A completely sandboxed iframe is considered, in essence, a new subdomain on the
client side. Access to JavaScript is not allowed; cookies can’t be read or written.
• A completely sandboxed inline frame cannot submit forms or run scripts.
These prohibitions can be “turned off” using a number of attributes:
• allow-same-origin allows the iframe to pull in content from elsewhere in the
same domain.
• allow-forms permits the submission of forms in the sandboxed iframe.
• allow-scripts allows the sandboxed iframe to run scripts from the same domain.
These attributes can be used separately, or together as space-separated values. The order of
the attributes does not affect any functionality.
<iframe src="content.htm" sandbox="allow-same-origin
allow-forms allow-scripts">
<iframe src="content.htm" sandbox="allow-forms">

HTML5 drops presentational iframe attributes such as frameborder, scrolling,
marginwidth, and marginheight. The attributes name, height, width, and the allimportant src remain part of the specification. HTML5 also adds global attributes to all
HTML5 tags, including <iframe>. See Chapter 3 for an in-depth discussion of these

attributes.
Under HTML5, the <iframe> tag can also be written XHTML style, with a closing slash:

<iframe src="content.htm" height="200" width="200"
sandbox="allow-same-origin" />

PART I

HTML5 proposes two new attributes for the iframe element: seamless and sandbox.
The seamless attribute effectively renders the iframe as an inline include, which allows
the parent document’s CSS to affect the contents of the iframe:

111

112

Part I:

Core Markup

Unfortunately, this syntax does not allow the inclusion of alternative content as shown here:
<iframe src="content.htm" height="200" width="200"
sandbox="allow-same-origin">
Your browser does not support iframes or its new HTML5 attributes.
You should be able to get a browser that does this in a few years.
</iframe>

It is still preferable to use traditional HTML-style markup to insert an iframe into an
HTML5 document.
At the time of this writing, HTML5 changes to <iframe> are not supported by any
browsers; however, Internet Explorer’s security attribute is quite similar to the intent of
HTML5’s sandbox attribute.

The draggable Attribute and the Drag and Drop API
HTML5 introduces drag and drop natively to the browser. Drag and drop has long been
implemented with JavaScript code that was not designed specifically for that purpose. Now
the logic is made much easier and cleaner as the HTML5 specification includes an attribute
and events that are intended exclusively for drag and drop.
In order to drag an item, the element must have the draggable attribute set to true:
<div id="dragme" class="box" draggable="true">I am a draggable div</div>

Everything else must be configured through JavaScript. There are several new events for
drag and drop. These are attached to HTML elements just as any other event using
addEventListener() or attachEvent().
The following events are attached to the item that will be dragged:
• dragstart The drag has begun.
• drag The element is being moved.
• dragend The drag has completed.
The rest of the events are attached to the drop area:
• dragenter The element is dragged into the drop area.
• dragover The element is dragged into the drop area. The default behavior here is
to cancel the drop, so it is necessary to hook up this event and then return false or
call preventDefault() to cancel the default behavior.
• dragleave The element is dragged out of the drop area.
• drop The element is dropped in the drop area.
Here we use JavaScript to hook up some of these events on a draggable box and a drop area:
var drag = document.getElementById("dragbox");
drag.addEventListener("dragstart",dragstart,false);
drag.addEventListener("dragend",dragend,false);

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

Each of these events contains a new event property called dataTransfer. This property is
used to customize the drag and drop and to pass data from the drag element to the drop
element. It supports the following properties itself:
• dropEffect Indicates the type of drag and drop expected for the drop zone. If it
does not match the effectAllowed set in the drag element, then the drop will be
canceled. The options are none, copy, link, and move; for example:
e.dataTransfer.dropEffect = "copy";

• effectAllowed Indicates the types of drag and drop that the dragging element
will allow. If it does not match the dropEffect in the drop zone, then the drop will
be canceled. The options are none, copy, copyLink, copyMove, link, linkMove,
move, all, and uninitialized; for example:
e.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = "move";

• types Presents a list of content types that the draggable data contains:
if (e.dataTransfer.types.contains("text/html")){
//do something;
}

• clearData() Resets the data in the drag element.
e.dataTransfer.clearData();

• setData(format,data) Sets data to be sent to the drop zone. The format field
expects a string to indicate the format of the data being passed.
e.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain","Simple String");
e.dataTransfer.setData("text/html","<strong>HTML String</strong>");

• getData(format) Fetches the data set by the drag item. Only returns the data
that matches the format type.
e.dataTransfer.getData("text/html"); //returns <strong>HTML String</
strong>

• setDragImage(element,x,y) When an item is being dragged, it is possible for
the drag shadow to be set to any element. It can be an element on the page, an image,
a newly created element, or even a canvas drawing. The x,y coordinates indicate
where the mouse should attach to the shadow.
e.dataTransfer.setDragImage(document.getElementById("shadowimage",10,
10));

With the methods and properties exposed in the dataTransfer property, the drag
and drop is quite powerful. One exceptional feature is the ability to drag anything
into a drop zone and retrieve the content via getData(). This includes URLs from
the address bar, HTML from other pages, and text from Notepad documents.

contenteditable Attribute
First introduced by Internet Explorer, the proprietary contenteditable attribute is
supported by most browsers today. HTML5 standardizes the use of this attribute globally
on all elements. The basic sense of the attribute is that if you set it to true, the browser
should allow you to modify the text directly when you click the element:
<p contenteditable="true">This paragraph of text is editable. Click it
and you will see. Of course there is no sense of saving it with code to
transmit the information to the server. This paragraph of text is editable.
Click it and you will see. Of course there is no sense of saving it with
code to transmit the information to the server.</p>

The browser may or may not present a style change to show you are in “edit mode.”

Style change

versus

No style change
upon edit

It is possible to use JavaScript to enable content editing by changing the corresponding

contentEditable property for the element. For example, the following changes this
property and updates the class name to reflect a style change when in edit mode.
<p ondblclick="this.contentEditable=true;this.className='inEdit';"
onblur="this.contentEditable=false;this.className='';">This paragraph
uses some simple script to be editable. Double-click the text to
begin editing.</p>

spellcheck Attribute
HTML5 defines a spellcheck attribute globally for elements. Interestingly, some browsers
such as Firefox have supported spell checking of form fields and elements in content editing
mode using the contenteditable attribute for some time. HTML5 makes this attribute
standard.
Enabling the spell checking of element content is a matter of setting the spellcheck
attribute to true:
<p spellcheck="true">Spellcheck on: There is a tyyypooo here.
Did the browser spot it?</p>

Testing in supporting browsers shows that indication on content editable regions appears
when there is a spelling error. However, there is unclarity in the specification whether the
user must be in edit mode before the indication should be displayed.

Commonly, this attribute is a bit more useful on form fields, given their interactive nature:
<label>Text field: (spellcheck on)
<input type="text" name="textfield" spellcheck="true" value="There is a
tyyypoo here. Did the browser spot it?"></label>

Given the application of single-line text fields, it is far more useful to set this attribute
on multiline text fields defined by a <textarea> tag, like so:
<label>Text area: (spellcheck on) <textarea name="comments"
spellcheck="true">There is a tyyypooo here. Did the browser spot it?
</textarea></label>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch2/spellcheck.html
NOTE Some browsers may invoke spell checking on elements—particularly the textarea
element—regardless of the presence and value of a spellcheck attribute.

Internationalization Improvements
While there are not many internationalization-supporting changes in the HTML5 specification,
it does make standard the ruby, rp, and rt elements, which were initially supported by the
Internet Explorer browsers to associate a reading text with a base text for certain East Asian
languages like Japanese. The base text that the annotation is associated with should be enclosed
in a <ruby> tag; the annotation, enclosed in a <rt> tag, will appear as smaller text above the
base text, and optionally an <rp> tag can be used to wrap content to delimit ruby text for
browsers that do not support this formatting:
<p>
<!-- The Kanji for Japanese language with the romanji above it or within
parens for non ruby aware browsers -->
<ruby>
日本語 <rp>(</rp><rt>nihongo</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>
</p>

HTML5 Metadata Changes
The next generation of Web sites will be loaded with metadata. Such “data about the data”
is needed to enable the semantic Web and to power emerging Web applications. HTML5
adds numerous attributes and defines metadata values that should assist the trend.

data-X Attributes
HTML5 defines a standard way to include developer-defined data attributes in tags, often
for the consumption by scripts. The general idea is to use the prefix data- and then pick
a variable name to include some non-visual data on a tag. For example, here an author
variable has been defined as custom data:
<p id="p1" data-author="Thomas A. Powell">This is a data-X example</p>

This value could then be read either by using the standard DOM getAttribute()
method,
<form>
<input type="button" value="Show Author" onclick="alert(document.
getElementById('p1').getAttribute('data-author')); ">
</form>

or by using new HTML5 DOM objects and properties for accessing such data:
<form>
<input type="button" value="Show Author" onclick="alert(document.
getElementById('p1').dataset.author);">
</form>

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

<p id="p1" author="Thomas A. Powell">This is a fake attribute example</p>

or using class values in a similar manner:
<p id="p1" class="author-Thomas-A.-Powell">This is a class data example</p>

This inappropriate use of markup is common since it is often useful to bury configuration
data in an element. Now, with the data- style attributes, we have a standard way of doing this
that will validate and hopefully reduce the conclusions that often ensue when overloading the
class attribute.

Microdata
HTML5 adds the concept of microdata, which adds the ability to annotate content in such
a way that a custom program will be able to parse the HTML page and retrieve items
consisting of name/value pairs of desired data. To create an item, the attribute itemscope
is added to a parent tag:
<div itemscope>
Dog's Name: Angus<br>
Dog's Age: 7<br>
Dog's Birthday: July 22<br>
Dog's Picture: <img src="angus.jpg">
</div>

Simply creating an item doesn’t do much without any name/value pairs. The attribute

itemprop is used to create the name/value pairs on the desired data. The itemprop

attribute is set to the name of the pair, and the value depends on what type of element

itemprop is set on. If the element is an audio, embed, iframe, img, source, or video
element, then the value is set to the src of that tag. If the element is an a, area, or link tag,
then the value is set to the href of that tag. If the element is a time tag, then the value is set
to the datetime attribute of that tag. If the element is a meta tag, then the value is set to the
content attribute of that tag. Otherwise, the value is set to the text of the tag.

As an example,

<div itemscope>
Dog's Name: <span itemprop="name">Angus</span><br>
Dog's Age: <span itemprop="age">7</span><br>
Dog's Birthday: <time itemprop="birthday" datetime="2002-07-22">July 22</
time><br>
Dog's Picture: <img itemprop="picture" src="angus.jpg">
<meta itemprop="entryID" content="498274">
</div>

would set the following name/value pairs:
name: Angus
age: 7
birthday: 2002-07-22
picture:angus.jpg
entryID: 498274

PART I

These attribute values should not be used by a user agent to style the page and are
solely for developer use. In many ways, the attribute is the direct consequence of people just
inventing attributes and forgoing validation,

117

Part I:

Core Markup

It is also possible to have an itemprop be another item by setting the itemscope
attribute in the same tag as the one in which the itemprop attribute is set. This creates a
hierarchy of data:
<div itemscope>
Dog's Name: <span itemprop="name">Angus</span><br>
Dog's Age: <span itemprop="age">7</span><br>
Dog's Birthday: <time itemprop="birthday" datetime="2004-07-22">July 22</
time><br>
Dog's Picture: <img itemprop="picture" src="angus.jpg"><br>
<meta itemprop="entryID" content="498274">
Current Points: <br>
<div itemprop="points" itemscope>
Appearance: <span itemprop="appearance">10</span><br>
Obedience: <span itemprop="obedience">8</span><br>
Talent: <span itemprop="talent">7.5</span><br>
</div>
</div>

In this example, the following hierarchy is added:
points:
appearance: 10
obedience: 8
talent: 7.5

It is also possible to have multiple items at the top level. We could simply create two
separate blocks of data:
<div itemscope>
Dog's Name: <span itemprop="name">Angus</span><br>
Dog's Age: <span itemprop="age">7</span><br>
Dog's Birthday: <time itemprop="birthday" datetime="2002-07-22">July 22</
time><br>
Dog's Picture: <img itemprop="picture" src="angus.jpg">
<meta itemprop="entryID" content="498274">
</div>
<div itemscope>
Dog's Name: <span itemprop="name">Kaylee</span><br>
Dog's Age: <span itemprop="age">13</span><br>
Dog's Birthday: <time itemprop="birthday" datetime="1995-11-26">November
26</time><br>
Dog's Picture: <img itemprop="picture" src="kaylee.jpg">
<meta itemprop="entryID" content="472391">
</div>

However, it might be necessary to intermingle data. If so, the itemref attribute can be
set on the parent item to a list of space separated IDs to indicate additional elements that
should be traversed to find name/value pairs for this item.
<div id="angus" itemscope itemref="introangus pictureangus"></div>
<div id="kaylee" item scope itemref="introkaylee picturekaylee"></div>
<p>There are two dogs in the competition today. <br>

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

In the previous examples, there is no way of saying what type of item each item block is,
which would prevent useful collection of the data. In order to specify a type, the itemtype
attribute is set in the parent element. This value must be in the form of a URL:
<div itemscope itemtype="http://htmlref.com/dogs">
Dog's Name: <span itemprop="name">Angus</span><br>
Dog's Age: <span itemprop="age">7</span><br>
Dog's Birthday: <time itemprop="birthday" datetime="2002-07-22">July 22</
time><br>
Dog's Picture: <img itemprop="picture" src="angus.jpg">
<meta itemprop="entryID" content="498274">
</div>

Here the itemprop attribute was still set to a string as we have seen in all previous
examples. However, it is also possible to set the value to be a URL value. In this case, the
value can be collected outside of the realm of the item. This might be useful in order to fetch
all email addresses or phone numbers despite what the itemtype is set to.
<div itemscope itemtype="http://htmlref.com/dogs">
Dog's Name: <span itemprop="http://htmlref.com/name">Angus</span><br>
Dog's Age: <span itemprop="http://htmlref.com/age">7</span><br>
Dog's Birthday: <time itemprop="http://htmlref.com/importantdates/birthday"
datetime="2002-07-22">July 22</time><br>
Dog's Picture: <img itemprop="http://htmlref.com/images/picture"
src="angus.jpg">
<meta itemprop="http://htmlref.com/contest/entryID" content="498274">
</div>

In these examples, a name/value pair has been used to set the entryID. However, if the
item is associated with a globally known ID, this ID can be set using the itemid attribute
on the parent element. This value must also be in the form of a URL.
<div itemscope itemtype="http://htmlref.com/dogs" itemid="http://htmlref.
com/dogs/entries/498274">
Dog's Name: <span itemprop="name">Angus</span><br>
Dog's Age: <span itemprop="age">7</span><br>
Dog's Birthday: <time itemprop="birthday" datetime="2002-07-22">July 22</
time><br>
Dog's Picture: <img itemprop="picture" src="angus.jpg">
</div>

So far, we have just been making up metadata, which is okay as long as you are the
primary target user of the data. However, for outside consumption, there are a number of
predefined types online that have defined vocabularies such as vCard, vEvent, BibTeX,

PART I

is <span itemprop="age">7</span> years old. </span><br>

and RDF. If one of these metadata types is used, it is necessary to abide by the defined set of
itemprop values that can be used. As an example, the following defines a vCard in HTML5
using microdata attributes:
<div itemscope itemtype="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard">
<h2 itemprop="fn">William Adama</h2>
<span itemprop="n" item>
<strong>Rank:</strong> <span itemprop="honorific-prefix">Admiral</
span><br>
<strong>Nicknames:</strong><br>
<span itemprop="nickname">Bill</span><br>
</span>
<strong>Location: </strong>
<span itemprop="adr" item>
<span itemprop="region">Earth</span><br>
</span>
</div>

It is possible to have duplicate entries with the same itemprop name and different values:
<div itemscope itemtype="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard">
<h2 itemprop="fn">William Adama</h2>
<span itemprop="n" item>
<strong>Nicknames:</strong><br>
<span itemprop="nickname">Bill</span><br>
<span itemprop="nickname">Old Man</span><br>
<span itemprop="nickname">Husker</span><br>
</span>
</div>

It is also possible to have an itemprop with multiple names:
<div itemscope itemtype="http://microformats.org/profile/hcard">
<h2 itemprop="fn">William Adama</h2>
<strong>Rank:</strong> <span itemprop="title role">Admiral</span><br>
</div>

The HTML5 specification defines extensions to the DOM to support microdata. This
topic is outside the scope of our discussion, but note that these extensions are not required
to use microdata today because standard DOM methods and traversal schemes should be
able to access any added data.

HTML5: Beyond Markup
One quite controversial aspect of the HTML5 specification is its “kitchen sink” approach to
solving all the woes and inconsistencies of Web development. HTML5 does not just define
markup and how it should be handled by browsers; instead, it addresses in a fair amount of
depth, the intersection of markup and other technologies like CSS and JavaScript, discussing
correct usage, addressing networking issues, exposing security concerns, proposing metadata
applications, and more. In this sense, HTML5 can be criticized for being a bit unfocused at
times and reminds the author of past grand solution efforts in computing, most of which

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

defer Attribute
HTML5 standardizes the defer attribute, long supported by Internet Explorer, to help
improve page rendering. In the presence of a defer attribute on a script element, or
defer="defer" in the case of markup using XML-like syntax, a supporting browser
should delay executing, and even loading (in the case of linked scripts) to a future time.
As a simple example, the following are two inline scripts, the first with a defer attribute
and the second without:
<script defer type="text/javascript" defer>
alert("Deferred Script");
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
alert("Immediate Script ");
</script>

In supporting browsers, the first script would actually fire after the second. This
postponing of execution should also hold for external files and DOM inserted scripts as
well. Unfortunately, at the time of this edition’s writing, the actual execution pattern for
deferred scripts is variable in browsers:

but varies

HTML, JavaScript, and the DOM Renewed
The W3C’s DOM specifications (www.w3.org/DOM) provide the interface between
(X)HTML and JavaScript. These APIs allow Web developers to programmatically change
the very markup and style of Web pages, creating what is often dubbed dynamic HTML
(DHTML). While JavaScript hooks to markup and style are widely used, many browserspecific features have been introduced and many workarounds have been invented because
the specifications have stayed static for a number of years. HTML5 codifies many of these
practices.

PART I

unfortunately failed. However, to be fair, past HTML specifications have not adequately
considered the context of markup usage. The reality is that Web development technologies
must live together, so it makes sense that HTML5 discusses the intersection between HTML
and other technologies. This section provides a brief overview of some of the interesting
aspects of HTML5 that are not limited to markup.

121

122

Part I:

Core Markup

NOTE The term DHTML is more of a concept of using JavaScript a certain way with HTML and
CSS than a particular technology.

The DOM specifications have now been retired and the DOM bindings are specified
inside of the HTML5 specification itself. The HTML5 specification intermixes the definition
of an element’s markup with its script interface. All HTML elements have a basic interface
called HTMLElement, reproduced here:
interface HTMLElement : Element {
// DOM tree accessors
NodeList getElementsByClassName(in DOMString classNames);
// dynamic markup insertion
attribute DOMString innerHTML;
attribute DOMString outerHTML;
void insertAdjacentHTML(in DOMString position, in DOMString text);
// metadata attributes
attribute DOMString id;
attribute DOMString title;
attribute DOMString lang;
attribute DOMString dir;
attribute DOMString className;
readonly attribute DOMTokenList classList;
readonly attribute DOMStringMap dataset;
// microdata
attribute boolean itemScope;
attribute DOMString itemType;
attribute DOMString itemId;
attribute DOMString itemRef;
[PutForwards=value] readonly attribute DOMSettableTokenList itemProp;
readonly attribute HTMLPropertiesCollection properties;
attribute any itemValue;
// user interaction

void click();
void scrollIntoView();
void scrollIntoView(in boolean top);
attribute long tabIndex;

void blur();

readonly attribute DOMString accessKeyLabel;

attribute Function onscroll;
attribute Function onseeked;
attribute Function onseeking;
attribute Function onselect;
attribute Function onshow;
attribute Function onstalled;
attribute Function onsubmit;
attribute Function onsuspend;
attribute Function ontimeupdate;
attribute Function onvolumechange;
attribute Function onwaiting;
};

As you can see, this interface defines common attributes like id, title, lang, dir, and
so on. It also defines numerous event handlers like onclick, onscroll, onselect, and so
on that are associated with functions. Numerous methods are also defined.
Specific elements will inherit these scripting hooks and add to them. For example, note
the interface for the new HTML5 time element:
interface HTMLTimeElement : HTMLElement {
attribute DOMString dateTime;
attribute boolean pubDate;
readonly attribute Date valueAsDate;
};

This takes all the features of HTMLElement and adds to them dateTime, pubDate, and
valueAsDate properties.
As you look closely at the HTML5 script bindings, you’ll notice that the difference
between an HTML5 element’s attributes and the corresponding script properties is minimal.
In general, if an element has an attribute, its property will be the same, with two exceptions:
• If the name of an HTML attribute is composed of multiple words, the first letter of
the all but the first word is uppercase when the name is used as a scriptable
property name. For example, the time element has a pubdate attribute; following
the previous rule, the corresponding DOM property is pubDate.
• If the name of the attribute is a reserved word in JavaScript, it will be redefined
somehow. The most common attribute this rule is applied to is the class attribute,
which is widely used. The word “class” can’t be used as a scriptable property name
because keyword class is reserved for future versions of JavaScript. Thus, to
change the class attribute via JavaScript, use className instead.
As long as you are aware of these two rules, the mappings between markup and script
are actually pretty straightforward.
We certainly don’t expect you to become familiar with the DOM here; a sister book,
JavaScript: The Complete Reference, of nearly the same page count covers JavaScript and its
usage with HTML and CSS. However, we do want to make it clear that the HTML5
specification combines the DOM and markup specifications together, so from here on out
the two ideas should stay more in harmony. This is generally a good thing, though it does
make the specification quite a bit larger.

Chapter 2:

Introducing HTML5

Standardizing and Extending Ad Hoc JavaScript Conventions

into a named div element:
<div id="div1"></div>

Using the DOM, the code might look like this:
var str1,str2,str3;
var el1,el2;
el1 = document.createElement('p');
str1 = document.createTextNode('This is ');
el1.appendChild(str1);
el2 = document.createElement('strong');
str2 = document.createTextNode('just');
el2.appendChild(str2);
el1.appendChild(el2);
str3 = document.createTextNode('a test.');
el.appendChild(str3);
document.getElementById('div1').appendChild(el1);

Using chaining, it is possible to jam statements together, but the task is much easier
using Microsoft’s innerHTML property. Simply make a string like so
var newElements = "<p>This is <strong>just</strong> a test.</p>";

and then set the contents of the div to this string:
document.getElementById('div1').innerHTML = newElements;

By setting the innerHTML property, in effect, the browser’s parser is invoked, and it creates
elements from the string provided.
Given the wordiness of DOM methods, many developers prefer Microsoft’s innerHTML
scheme and thus it has been widely copied and put into other browsers. However, HTML5
does not cover all of Microsoft’s other, related properties like innerText and outerText,
though outerHTML for now appears to be covered.

PART I

One important aspect of the HTML5 specification is that a number of the messy aspects of
JavaScript and its usage within a Web browser finally have a specification. Various
JavaScript objects like Navigator, History, and more are not really part of any standard
other than an ad hoc one. In many cases, proprietary JavaScript objects, properties, and
methods are documented, but only by the originating vendors, and other implementations
that may or may not conform to this proprietary specification may exist.
Probably the most famous of the proprietary turned common features in JavaScript is
Microsoft’s innerHTML property, which allows for quick creation of new markup in
documents. This property is commonly used by Web developers who accept that it is
widely implemented and quite useful compared to standard DOM techniques. As a
demonstration, consider the code needed to insert the following markup:

126

Part I:

Core Markup

It is interesting that many developers are quite okay with the use of innerHTML but are
quick to deride the use of JavaScript’s eval() statement. In many ways, these are the same
concepts: the former provides direct access to the markup parser and the latter provides
direct access to the JavaScript interpreter. Regardless of the consistency of Web developers’
thinking patterns, the codification of innerHTML is quite a welcome change.
The embrace of common practices by HTML5 isn’t limited to innerHTML; the specification
supports all sorts of features, such as designMode features that allow for browser-based
WYSIWYG editing, commonly used DOM workarounds like insertAdjacentHTML(),
emerging DOM methods like getElementsByClassName(), more-esoteric DOM
specifications like ranges and selections, and more.
The specification also provides APIs for what it introduces. We explored just such an
API earlier in the chapter when we experimented with canvas scripting. Similarly, elements
like audio and video expose a number of properties such as volume and methods such as
play().
There is much to be discovered when reading the HTML5 specification closely. Consider,
for example, how browsers handle runaway script code. There really is nothing online that
defines how or when this is done, but the HTML5 specification actually starts to address
such problems (section 6.5.3.4):
User agents may impose resource limitations on scripts, for example, CPU quotas,
memory limits, total execution time limits, or bandwidth limitations. When a
script exceeds a limit, the user agent may either throw a QUOTA_EXCEEDED_
ERR exception, abort the script without an exception, prompt the user, or throttle
script execution.
If you take the time to read the specification, you will find many passages such as this
that offer hope that someday troubling corner cases in Web development will be reduced or
even eliminated. However, you might also get a sense that the aims of the specification are
a bit too grand. You can find bits and pieces of half-baked ideas about undo-redo handling;
subtle hints about important architectural changes, such as the management of history for
supporting Ajax applications; discussion of offline features and storage schemes; and
documentation of a variety of communication schemes, from interframe message posting to
full-blown Web Socket communication. In some cases, these diversion APIs will spawn their
own documents, but in other cases they just clutter the specification. The critics really do
have a point here.

Major HTML5 Themes
As we wind down the chapter, we need to take a look at some of the major themes of HTML5.
These are deep issues that you will encounter over and over again in the Web development
community. These are presented mostly to spur your thinking rather than to offer a definitive
answer, because HTML5 is quite a moving target.

HTML5 Today or Tomorrow?
The simple question that you must have about HTML5 is, can I use it yet? The answer is
yes. You can embrace the future just by adopting the simple <!DOCTYPE html> statement.
Of course, that isn’t very interesting, so your question really is, can I use any of the new

Figure 2-7 shows the rendering of the example in two common browsers. Note that
Internet Explorer 8 and earlier has some trouble with the new elements.
To address Internet Explorer’s lack of support, we can introduce a small script that
creates the new HTML5 elements using the DOM createElement() method. Once IE
recognizes them as elements, it renders the markup and style fine, as shown in Figure 2-8.

HTML5 works straightaway in many browsers, but not IE.

NOTE Because the preceding “shim” script uses condition comments to make it work in Internet
Explorer, it will not validate well. There are ways around this if you want to use browser
detection. The point of the script is to illustrate the ability to make HTML5 work everywhere.
You can expect that the code will change over time or other hacks will be introduced.

When moving beyond simple HTML5 semantic elements to interactive features, the
situation is a bit dicier. Certainly JavaScript can be used to simulate many features, but until
such features are solidly supported, you should proceed with caution.
Opponents of HTML5 throw out an estimated final version date of 2012 or even 2022 as
a reason to avoid the technology for now. Yes, indeed, some timelines suggest that HTML5
won’t be completely final until maybe 2022. Of course, plenty aspects of HTML5 are

implemented today, and it is more likely that preliminary versions of the specification will
be accepted at the time you read this. If you want to avoid using a specification until it is
100 percent complete, you should note that even HTML 4 has some open implementation
and testing concerns, so you might want to head back to earlier versions. Seriously, what
really should matter with a specification like HTML5 is whether you can use many of its
features. The answer to that question is clearly yes.

HTML5 as a Catch-All
HTML is part of a bigger world. A modern Web site or application really needs much more
than markup and must address style, script, media elements, network concerns, security
issues, user capabilities, and much more. Because of the environment in which it is found,

Chapter 2:

HTML5: Web Politics as Usual
The Web is an interesting place technology-wise because the mob tends to rule. Very often,
well-defined specifications will be built only to be avoided or replaced by ad hoc specifications
that appear to spring out of nowhere. HTML5 tries to tame the mob and bring a bit of order
to the chaos, but that doesn’t come easily, particularly when politics and competition are
involved.
On the Web, there are those who promote openness, and those who promote new
proprietary features for their own browsers. Some will label such organizations good or
bad, and declare their technology the one true way over others. Such promotion of us
versus them can create loyal followers, but the author finds some of the discussion more
than a bit disingenuous.
Web technologies that were once maligned as proprietary Microsoft features, such as
innerHTML, contenteditable, Ajax XMLHttpRequest object, and more, have been quietly
absorbed into the open Web community. Other capabilities such as CSS transformations,
behaviors, Web fonts, and animations found in Internet Explorer—in many cases for the better
part of a decade—are also maligned as proprietary only to be reintroduced with slight syntax
differences by other browser vendors to hails of the progress of the open Web. “Today
proprietary, tomorrow standard” seems to be the rule of Web standards, and it would seem
that now HTML5 is doing its part to continue politics as usual.
Google has already begun a tremendous push to promote HTML5. The problem is the term
is basically being used as a comparison as to what a major competitor is not supporting, more
than a lucid discussion of the emerging technology. Unfortunately, from my observations,
when most people speak of HTML5, it is more as a code for open Web or even anti-Microsoft,
which reminds me of other misused terms of the last browser battles. Let’s hope that cool
heads prevail in the standards fights that will likely ensue.

HTML5: Imperfect Improvement
HTML5 is an imperfect improvement for an imperfect Web world. We simply can’t force the
masses to code their markup right. HTML5 doesn’t try to accomplish this fool’s errand but
instead finds a reasonable path of defining what to do with such malformed markup at the
browser level.
The HTML5 specification is too big. It’s a sprawling specification and covers many
things. However, it tries to document that which is ad hoc and make decisions about issues
left unsolved. Something is better than nothing.

PART I

the HTML5 specification seems to touch all manner of topics. In this sense, its critics have a
point about its “everything and the kitchen sink” nature. However, it is impossible for
markup to live in a vacuum, so some overlap and environmental considerations are to be
expected.
Unfortunately, given that it looks like a catch-all specification, many people misunderstand
the technology and use the idea of HTML5 simply to refer to anything that is new in a Web
browser. HTML5 doesn’t talk about CSS properties. HTML5 doesn’t define Web fonts.
HTML5 doesn’t change HTTP. While the specification is huge, there is plenty outside of it,
so why is there such a misconception that it covers everything? Well, that’s the politics of
the Web at work.

131

132

Part I:

Core Markup

The HTML5 specification is a work in progress. Writing a book about such a moving
target is more than a bit of a challenge. However, like the specification itself, something had
to be done. It will take too long to finish the specification, and in the meantime people want
to use some of the new elements that are already supported.
HTML5 will change the Web, but the old Web will likely live on. Thinking that HTML5
is going to take the world by storm, co-opting standard practices and usurping technologies
like Flash in short order, is fanciful. The old ways will continue to live on and it will be quite
some time before HTML5 ideas are even commonplace.
HTML5 won’t solve all the problems you encounter as a Web developer. In fact, a safe
prediction is that it will introduce even more trouble, particularly as we transition from the
old ways to the new. And although the standard is evolving quickly, there are bound to be
fights among browser vendors, multiple interpretations of the standards, and the typical
dance between innovation and specification conformance.

Summary
HTML5 is the future. Working with the messed-up markup that dominates the Web and
providing a definition of how user agents should parse the mess is a tremendous
improvement in Web development. Yet HTML5 doesn’t simply embrace the past; it extends
the language with many more elements and continues the move to more semantic markup.
While some markup purists may bemoan the resurgence of HTML traditions, the XML
future is not destroyed by HTML5. If you want to use lowercase, quote all attributes, and
self-close empty elements, go right ahead—that conforms to HTML5 as well. However,
HTML5 isn’t just about markup; it is also about metadata, media, Web applications, APIs,
and more. It’s a sprawling specification that will continue to evolve, but much of it is here
today, so get busy and embrace the future of markup now.

CHAPTER

HTML and XHTML
Element Reference

T

his chapter provides a complete reference for the elements in the HTML 4.01 and
XHTML 1.0 specifications. All known HTML5 elements at the time of this edition’s
writing are covered as well, but given the fluid nature of the specification, some
elements may have been omitted or syntax may have changed by the time of publication.
You are encouraged to proceed with caution when considering the HTML5 information
because, again at the time of this writing, the specification is in flux and few of the elements
discussed work natively in browsers. Proprietary features discussed in this reference also
should be treated with some caution. All the browser-specific elements and attributes
supported by Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Netscape, and Opera are presented.
Some elements presented in the reference might be deprecated, but they are included
nevertheless either because browser vendors continue to support them or because they may
still be found in use.

Flavors of HTML and XHTML
There are many versions of HTML and XHTML in existence (see Table 3-1). In the early
days, the specification of HTML was somewhat fluid, and browser vendors of all sizes
added their own elements. First the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and later the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) set standards for HTML and its cousin XHTML.

Description

HTML 2.0

www.w3.org/MarkUp/
html-spec/html-spec_toc.html

Classic HTML dialect supported by browsers
such as Mosaic. This form of HTML supports
core HTML elements and features such as
tables and forms, but does not consider any of
the browser innovations of advanced features
such as style sheets, scripting, or frames.

HTML 3.0

www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/
Contents.html

The proposed replacement for HTML 2.0 that
was never widely adopted, most likely due to
the heavy use of browser-specific markup.

HTML 3.2

www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32

This version of HTML finalized by the W3C in
early 1997 standardized most of the HTML
features introduced in browsers such as
Netscape 3. This speficifcation supports many
presentation elements, such as font, as well
as early support for some scripting features.

HTML 4.0
Transitional

www.w3.org/TR/html4/

The 4.0 transitional form finalized by the
W3C in December of 1997 preserves most
of the presentational elements of HTML 3.2.
It provides a basis of transition to Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) as well as a base set of
elements and attributes for multiple-language
support, accessibility, and scripting.

HTML 4.0 Strict

www.w3.org/TR/html4/

The strict version of HTML 4.0 removes most
of the presentation elements from the HTML
specification, such as font, in favor of using
CSS for page formatting.

4.0 Frameset

www.w3.org/TR/html4/

The frameset specification provides a rigorous
syntax for framed documents that was lacking
in previous versions of HTML.

HTML 4.01
Transitional/
Strict/Frameset

www.w3.org/TR/html401/

A minor update to the 4.0 standard that
corrects some of the errors in the original
specification.

HTML5

www.w3.org/TR/html5/

Addressing the lack of acceptance of the XML
reformulation of HTML by the mass of Web
page authors, the emerging HTML5 standard
originally started by the WHATWG group and
later rolled into a W3C effort aimed to rekindle
the acceptance of traditional HTML and extend
it to address Web application development,
multimedia, and the ambiguities found in
browser parsers. Since 2005, features now
part of this HTML specification have begun to
appear in Web browsers, muddying the future
of XHTML.

Description

XHTML 1.0
Transitional

www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/

A reformulation of HTML as an XML
application. The transitional form preserves
many of the basic presentation features of
HTML 4.0 transitional but applies the strict
syntax rules of XML to HTML.

XHTML 1.0 Strict

www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/

A reformulation of HTML 4.0 Strict using XML.
This language is rule enforcing and leaves all
presentation duties to technologies like CSS.

XHTML 1.1

www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/

A restructuring of XHTML 1.0 that modularizes
the language for easy extension and reduction.
It is not commonly used at the time of this
writing and offers minor gains over strict
XHTML 1.0.

XHTML 2.0

www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/

A new implementation of XHTML that will not
provide backward compatibility with XHTML 1.0
and traditional HTML. XHTML 2 will remove all
presentational tags and will introduce a variety
of new tags and ideas to the language. Beyond
this brief description, which may certainly be
wrong by the time you read it, little can be said
about XHTML 2 with certainty other than, given
HTML5, its future is somewhat questionable.

XHTML Basic 1.0

www.w3.org/TR/2000/RECxhtml-basic-20001219/

A variation of XHTML based upon the
modularization of XHTML (1.1) designed to
work with less-powerful Web clients such as
mobile phones.

XHTML Basic 1.1

www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/

An improvement to the XHTML Basic
specification that adds more features, some
fairly specific to the constrained interfaces
found in mobile devices.

TABLE 3-1

(X)HTML Specifications Overview (continued)

Core Attributes Reference
The HTML and XHTML specifications provide four main attributes that are common to
nearly all elements and have much the same meaning for all elements. These attributes are
class, id, style, and title. Rather than replicating this information throughout the
chapter, it is summarized here.

PART I

Version

135

136

Part I:

Core Markup

class
This attribute indicates the class or classes that a particular element belongs to. A class name
might be used by a style sheet to associate style rules with multiple elements or for script
access using the getElementsByClassName() method. As an example, you could associate
a special class name called “fancy” with all elements that should be rendered with a
particular style named as such in a style sheet. Class values are not unique to a particular
element, so both <strong class="fancy"> and <p class="fancy"> could be used in
the same document. It also is possible to have multiple values for the class attribute
separated by white space; <strong class="fancy special expensive"> would define
three classes for the particular strong element.

id
This attribute specifies a unique alphanumeric identifier to be associated with an element.
Naming an element is important to being able to access it with a style sheet, a link, or a
scripting language. Names should be unique to a document and should be meaningful;
although id="x1" is perfectly valid, id="Paragraph1" might be better. Values for the id
attribute must begin with a letter (A–Z or a–z) and may be followed by any number of
letters, digits, hyphens, or periods. However, practically speaking, a period character
should not be used within an id value given the use of these values in scripting languages
and possible confusion with class names.
Once elements are named with id, they should be easy to manipulate with a scripting
language. Commonly they are referenced using the DOM method getElementById().
Like the class attribute, the id attribute is also used by style sheets for accessing a
particular element. For example, an element named Paragraph1 can be referenced by a
style rule in a document-wide style by using a fragment identifier:
#Paragraph1

{color: blue;}

Once an element is named using id, it also is a potential destination for an anchor. In
the past, an a element was used to set a destination; now, any element can be a destination,
for example:
<a href="#mainContent">Skip to content</a>
<div id="mainContent">This is the content of the page.</div>

One potential problem with the id attribute is that, for some elements, particularly form
controls and images, the name attribute already serves its function. You should be careful
when using both name and id together, especially when using older element syntax with
newer styles. For example, from a linking point of view, the following markup might be
used to set a link destination:
<a name="anchorPoint"></a>

At some other point in the document, an id with the same named value might exist, like so:
<p id="anchorPoint">I am the same destination?</p>

There is some uncertainty, then, about what this link would do:
<a href="#anchorPoint">Where do I go?</a>

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

<input type="text" name="username">

However, the id attribute also is applied to form controls for style purposes and overlap
for scripting duties, so it is not uncommon to see name and id used together with the same
value:
<input type="text" name="username" id="username">

Generally, this is an acceptable practice except when the purpose of name serves secondary
duty, such as in the case of radio buttons:
<label>Yes:
<input type="radio" name="yesno" id="yesno" value="yes">
</label>
<label>No:
<input type="radio" name="yesno" id="yesno" value="no">
</label>

In the preceding markup, the radio buttons must share the name value, but the id values
should be unique for CSS and JavaScript usage. A simple rewrite like this makes it work, but
shows that name and id are not quite synonymous:
<label>Yes:
<input type="radio" name="yesno" id="yesno-yeschoice" value="yes">
</label>
<label>No:
<input type="radio" name="yesno" id="yesno-nochoice " value="no">
</label>

Given such chance for confusion, you are encouraged to pick a naming strategy and use
it consistently.

style
This attribute specifies an inline style associated with an element, which determines the
rendering of the affected element. Because the style attribute allows style rules to be used
directly with the element, it gives up much of the benefit of style sheets that divide the
presentation of a markup document from its structure. An example of this attribute’s use is
shown here:
<strong style="font-family: Arial;
font-size: 18px;">Important text</strong>

PART I

Would it go to the first link defined or would it go to the last? Would it favor the element
using the id over the name regardless of position in the document? It’s better not to leave
such issues to chance but rather to assume that name and id are in the same namespace, at
least when linking is concerned.
With form elements, the choice of using name and id can be more confusing. The name
attribute lives on and must be used to specify name/value pairs for form data:

137

138

Part I:

Core Markup

title
The title attribute is used to provide advisory text about an element or its contents. Given
<p title="Hey look I am a title tooltip!">
This is the first paragraph of text.
</p>

the title attribute sets some message on this first paragraph. Browsers generally display this
advisory text in the form of a tooltip, as shown here:

In some cases, such as when applied to the a element, the title attribute can provide
additional help in bookmarking. Like the title for the document itself, title attribute
values such as advisory information should be short, yet useful. For example, <p title="A
paragraph"> provides little information of value, whereas <p title="HTML: The
Complete Reference - Title Example"> provides much more detail. The attribute can
take an arbitrary amount of text, but the wrapping and presentation of larger titles will
likely vary.

NOTE As of the writing of this edition, no formatting can be applied within advisory text, though
the HTML5 specification does indicate that Unicode linefeeds (\u000A) should eventually be
supported.

When combined with scripting, this attribute can provide facilities for automatic index
generation.

Language Attributes Reference
The use of other languages in addition to English in a Web page might require that the text
direction be changed from left to right or right to left or might require other localization
modifications. Once supporting non-ASCII languages becomes easier, it might be more
common to see documents in mixed languages. Thus, there must be a way to indicate the
language in use and its formatting. The basic language attributes are summarized here to
avoid redundancy.

dir
The dir attribute sets the text direction as related to the lang attribute. The accepted values
under the HTML 4.01 specification are ltr (left to right) and rtl (right to left). It should be
possible to override whatever direction a user agent sets by using this attribute with the bdo
element:
<div>
Standard text running left to right in most cases.
<bdo dir="rtl">Napoleon never really said <q>Able was I ere
I saw Elba.</q></bdo> More standard text.
</div>

Other Common Attributes Reference
The are a number of common attributes found on elements. Microsoft in particular
introduced a number of new proprietary attributes starting with the Internet Explorer 4
browser. Recently, with the introduction of Internet Explorer 8, proprietary features have
become less common. Interestingly, many of these features are supported by other browsers,
given the desire of their developers to emulate IE, the currently most popular browser. The
attributes continue to be supported and, in some cases, such as contenteditable, have
approached de facto standard and in some cases attributes have become part of HTML5.
Given their ubiquity, these attributes are summarized here to avoid redundancy when
presenting the various elements.

accesskey
Microsoft applied this W3C attribute to a wider variety of elements than form elements. The
accesskey attribute specifies a keyboard navigation accelerator for the element. Pressing
ALT or a similar key (depending on the browser and operating system) in association with
the specified key selects the anchor element correlated with that key.
If access keys are employed, Web page authors are cautioned to be aware of predefined
key bindings in the browsing environment, a sampling of which is detailed in Table 3-2.

NOTE If you take into consideration some older and esoteric browsers, there are even more preset
keys to avoid.

PART I

The lang attribute indicates the language being used for the enclosed content. The language
is identified using the ISO standard language abbreviations, such as fr for French, en for
English, and so on. RFC 1766 (www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1766.txt) describes these codes and their
formats.

140

Part I:

Core Markup

Also note that the UK government has recommended that, for accessibility, certain key
bindings should be predefined in UK Web sites. These suggested values are found in Table 3-3.
Page authors are also encouraged to consider styling or providing script-based schemes
to reveal accesskey bindings because they may not be obvious to users even when a
convention like the UK bindings is employed.

align
Many browsers define the align attribute on elements. Transitional versions of (X)HTML
do as well. This attribute generally takes a value of left, right, or center, which
determines how the element and its contents are positioned in a table or the window. The
value of left is usually the default. In some cases, a value of justify is also supported.
CSS properties like text-align and margin should be used instead of this attribute when
possible.

contenteditable
This proprietary Microsoft attribute, now part of the HTML5 specification, allows users to
directly edit content in a browser. Values are false, true, and inherit. A value of false
prevents content from being edited by users; true allows editing. The default value,
inherit, applies the value of the affected element’s parent element. In addition to Internet
Explorer, all recent major browsers, such as Firefox 3+, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+, also
support this attribute.

datafld

dataformatas
This Internet Explorer–specific attribute indicates whether the bound data is plain text or
HTML.

datasrc
This attribute indicates the name of the data source object that supplies the data that is
bound to this element. This attribute is specific to Microsoft’s data binding.

disabled
Again, Microsoft has applied an existing W3C attribute to a range of elements not associated
with it in the W3C specifications. Elements with the disabled attribute set may appear
faded and will not respond to user input. Values under the Microsoft implementation are
true and false. When the attribute is present, the default value is true, so IE 5.5 and
higher will read disabled as “on,” even without a value set for the attribute.

height
This attribute specifies the height, in pixels, needed by an embedded object, image, iframe,
applet, or any other embeddable item.

hidefocus
This proprietary attribute, introduced with Internet Explorer 5.5, hides focus on an
element’s content. Focus will generally be represented with a dotted outline, but elements
with this attribute set to true will not show such an indication.

hspace
This attribute specifies additional horizontal space, in pixels, to be reserved on either side of
an embedded item like an iframe, applet, image, and so on.

language
In the Microsoft implementation, this attribute specifies the scripting language to be used
with an associated script bound to the element, typically through an event handler attribute.
Possible values might include javascript, jscript, vbs, and vbscript. Other values
that include the version of the language used, such as JavaScript1.1, might also be
possible. The reason this feature is supported is that it is possible in Internet Explorer to
run multiple script languages at the same time, which requires that you indicate on
element-level event handlers which scripting language is in play, as demonstrated here:
<p onclick="alert('Hi from JavaScript');" language="JavaScript">
Click me (JavaScript)</p>
<p onclick="MsgBox('Hi from VBScript')" language="VBScript">
Click me (VBScript)</p>

PART I

This attribute specifies the column name from the data source object that supplies the
bound data. This attribute is specific to Microsoft’s data binding.

142

Part I:

Core Markup

tabindex
This attribute uses a number to identify the object’s position in the tabbing order for
keyboard navigation using the TAB key. While tabindex is defined for some elements as
part of W3C standards, IE 5.5 added support for this attribute to a wider range of elements.
Under IE 5.5 or higher, this focus can be disabled with the hidefocus attribute.

unselectable
This proprietary Microsoft attribute can be used to prevent content displayed from being
selected. Testing suggests that this might not work consistently. Values are off (selection
permitted) and on (selection not allowed).

vspace
This attribute specifies additional vertical space, in pixels, to be reserved above and below
an embedded object, image, iframe, applet, or any other embeddable item.

width
This attribute specifies the width, in pixels, needed by an embedded object, image, iframe,
applet, or any other embeddable item.

Common HTML5 Attributes Reference
HTML5 introduces a number of common attributes to many elements. Some of these have
been discussed in the previous section, while others are all new. For the sake of avoiding
repetition in entries, each is discussed here and then shown only in the syntax list later. As
you were warned at the beginning of the chapter, this information is based upon the draft
HTML5 specification and is subject to change. Check the HTML5 specification at www
.w3.org/TR/html5 for updates and changes. Further note that while some of these attributes
are already implemented in Internet Explorer (such as contenteditable) or other modern
browsers, many are not yet implemented, so their usage may be somewhat speculative.

NOTE One interesting aspect of these attributes is that while they are defined in the HTML5

specification on all elements, their meaning is unclear or suspect in certain cases. For example,
spell checking images or using interface conventions like accelerators or context menus on
nonvisible elements, particularly those in the head (like meta), simply don’t make sense. What
the spec says and what will actually be implemented or used will likely vary.

accesskey
Under HTML5, the accesskey attribute specifies a keyboard navigation accelerator for the
element. The main differences between this and the commonly supported attribute are that
it can be applied, in theory, to any element in the specification and that it takes a spaceseparated list of key choices. For example,
<form>
<input type="button" value="Show Author" accesskey="t a p">
</form>

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

contenteditable
Initially a proprietary Microsoft attribute, this HTML5 attribute when set allows users to
directly edit content rendered in the browser. Values are false, true, and inherit. A
value of false prevents content from being edited by users; true allows editing. The
default value, inherit, applies the value of the affected element’s parent element.

contextmenu
The contextmenu attribute is used to define an element’s context menu, which is generally
the menu invoked upon a mouse right-click. The attribute’s value should hold a string that
references the id value of a <menu> tag found in the DOM. If there is no element found or
no value, then the element has no special context menu and the user agent should show its
default menu. Internet Explorer and many other browsers support an oncontextmenu
attribute that could be used to implement the idea of this emerging attribute.

data-X (Custom Data Attributes)
HTML5 defines a standard way to include developer-defined data attributes in tags, often
for the consumption by script. The general idea is to use the prefix data- and then pick a
variable name to include some nonvisual data on a tag. For example, here an author
variable has been defined as custom data:
<p id="p1" data-author="Thomas A. Powell">This is a data-X example</p>

This value could then be read using the standard DOM getAttribute() method,
<form>
<input type="button" value="Show Author" onclick="alert(document.
getElementById('p1').getAttribute('data-author')); ">
</form>

or using new HTML5 DOM objects and properties for accessing such data:
<form>
<input type="button" value="Show Author" onclick="alert(document.
getElementById('p1').dataset.author);">
</form>

These attribute values should not be used by a user agent to style when rendering and
are solely for developer use. In many ways, the attribute is the direct consequence of people
just inventing attributes and forgoing validation,
<p id="p1" data-author="Thomas A. Powell">This is a fake attribute example</p>

PART I

allows you to accelerate this button simply by pressing a special key like ALT in conjunction
with the character values present in the attribute. There is some discussion about the
attribute eventually supporting words rather than just individual keys.

143

144

Part I:

Core Markup

or using class values in a similar manner:
<p id="p1" class="author-Thomas-A.-Powell">This is a class data example</p>

NOTE Special characters, particularly colons, should not be used in the data- names here. You are
also encouraged to keep the names lowercase for consistency.

draggable
This attribute is used to set whether or not an element is draggable. If the attribute is set to
true, the element is draggable. A value of auto sets images and links with an href to be
draggable and all other items to not be draggable. A false value turns off dragging.
<p draggable="true">Drag me</p>
<p draggable="false">Sorry no drag</p>

Real integration with elements with draggable attributes requires JavaScript usage (see
Chapter 2 for an example).

hidden
This attribute is a Boolean, or presence-based, attribute that does not require a value. If
you’re using XHTML5, you should use the value of hidden, as attributes must have values
with XML syntax.
<p hidden>I'm hidden</p>
<p hidden="hidden">I'm hidden XML syntax style</p>

When this attribute is specified on an element, the element is not currently relevant and
thus the user agent should not render it. The exact meaning of the attribute is a bit unclear.
It would appear to be similar to the semantics of the CSS property display:none, but the
specification hints that elements that are hidden are active and thus it also is somewhat
different from this common construct. Once browsers implement this attribute, the meaning
may be clarified. This attribute was initially called irrelevant in earlier HTML5 drafts.

itemid
This attribute is used to set a global identifier for a microdata item. This is an optional
attribute, but if it is used, it must be placed in an element that sets both the itemscope and
itemtype attributes. The value must be in the form of a URL.
<div itemscope itemtype="http://ssa.gov/People"
itemid="http://ssa.gov/SSN/123456789">
<span itemprop="firstname">Joe</span>
<span itemprop="lastname">Smith</span>
</div>

itemprop
This attribute is used to add a name/value pair to a microdata item. Any child of a tag with
an itemscope attribute can have an itemprop attribute set in order to add a property to

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

<div itemscope>
<time itemprop="gameday" datetime="2010-06-22">June 22</time>:
The <span itemprop="visitor">Giants</span> at
<span itemprop="home">A's</span>.<br>
<meta itemprop="city" content="Oakland">
</div>

If the item is set to one of the predefined types, then there is a specific set of values that is
allowed for the itemprop.

itemref
This attribute is set to indicate what additional elements should be traversed to look for
name/value pairs for the item. By default, only the children are searched. However,
sometimes it does not make sense to have a single parent item if the data is intermingled.
In this case, itemref can be set to a space-separated list of additional elements to traverse:
<div itemscope itemref="parentname parentfood"></div>
<div itemscope itemref="childname childfood"></div>
<span id="parentname"><span itemprop="name">Thomas</span></span> has a
daughter named <span id="childname"><span itemprop="name">Olivia</span>
</span>.
Thomas' favorite food is <span id="parentfood"><span itemprop="food">sushi
</span></span> and Olivia's is <span id="childfood"><span
itemprop="food">French Fries</span>!

itemscope
This attribute is used to set an element as an item of microdata (see Chapter 2 for more
information on microdata). An element with an itemscope attribute creates a new item that
contains a group of name/value pairs defined by enclosed elements with itemprop
attributes. For example,
<div itemscope>
<span itemprop="firstname">Thomas</span>
<span itemprop="lastname">Powell</span>
</div>

sets name/value pairs of firstname: Thomas and lastname: Powell for the item
declared in the <div>.

PART I

that item. The name of the property is the value set for the itemprop attribute. The value
depends on what type of element the attribute is added to. If the element is an audio,
embed, iframe, img, source, or video tag, then the value is set to the src of that tag.
If the element is an a, area, or link tag, then the value is set to the href of that tag. If
the element is a time tag, then the value is set to the datetime attribute of that tag. If the
element is a meta tag, then the value is set to the content attribute of that tag. Otherwise,
the value is set to the textContent of the tag. A brief example is shown here.

This attribute is used in conjunction with the itemscope attribute in order to define a type
for the microdata item. This is an optional attribute, but if used, it must be placed in the
same element that sets the itemscope attribute. The value must be in the form of a URL:
<div itemscope itemtype="http://scores.sports.com/baseball"></div>
<span itemscope itemtype="http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Work"></span>

spellcheck
This attribute is set to either true or false and indicates whether the content enclosed by
the element should be spelling and grammar checked:
<p spellcheck="true">How do you spell potatoe? A man named Dan may never
know.</p>

If it has no value, the assumed value is true unless it inherits false from an enclosing
parent. The attribute is meaningful on elements that are interactive for text entry, such as
form fields, or elements that have contenteditable=true.

tabindex
This attribute, like the tabindex attribute initially defined by Internet Explorer, uses a
number to identify the object’s position in the tabbing order for keyboard navigation using
the TAB key. The attribute should be set to a numeric value. User agents will generally move
through fields with tabindex set in increasing numeric order, skipping any elements with 0
or a negative value. After moving over all tabindex values, any 0 valued fields will be
navigated in order, but negative values will continue to be skipped. Nonnumeric values will
generally result in the browser applying its normal focusing algorithm.

Event Attributes Reference
In preparation for a more dynamic Web, the W3C has defined a set of core events that
are associated with nearly every (X)HTML element via an event attribute of the style
oneventname (for example, onclick). Most of these events cover simple user interaction,
such as the click of a mouse button or the press of a keyboard key. A few elements, such as
form controls, have some special events associated with them. For example, form events
might indicate that the field has received focus from the user or that the form was
submitted. Intrinsic events, such as a document loading and unloading, are also defined. All
the W3C-defined event attributes are described in Table 3-4.
This event model is commonly extended and is not complete. It will certainly change as
HTML5 is implemented and the Document Object Model (DOM) is extended. More
information about the DOM can be found at www.w3.org/DOM. Browser vendors are
already busy paving the way with their own events.

HTML5 Events
The event model defined by HTML5 is still emerging, but the common event-handling
attributes are fairly clear and match most of the HTML 4 events, with some interesting new

additions. Some of the newer features are already implement in Internet Explorer or other
browsers but many are not. Table 3-5 summarizes all the events you may see on the various
previewed HTML5 elements in this chapter. As all things concerning HTML5, the
specification (www.w3.org/TR/html5) is the best place to go for the latest information.

Internet Explorer’s Extended Event Attributes
Most browsers support events other than those defined in the W3C specifications. Microsoft,
in particular, has introduced a variety of events to capture more-complex mouse actions such
as dragging, element events such as the bouncing of marquee text, data-binding events
signaling the loading of data into an object, and fine-grained event control to catch events

Event Attribute

Event Description

onabort

Invoked generally by the cancellation of an image load but may happen
on any communication that aborts (for example, Ajax calls). Abort events
do not have to target the element directly because any abort event that
bubbles through an element can be caught.

onafterprint

Called after a print event. Found only on the body element.

onbeforeprint

Called before a print event. Found only on the body element.

onbeforeunload

Invoked just before a page or object is unloaded from the user agent.

onblur

Occurs when an element loses focus, meaning that the user has moved
focus to another element, typically either by clicking the mouse or by tabbing.

oncanplay

Fires when a media element can be played but not necessarily
continuously for its complete duration without potential buffering.

oncanplaythrough

Fires when a media element can be played and should play its complete
duration uninterrupted.

onchange

Signals that the form control has lost user focus and its value has been
modified during its last access.

onclick

Indicates that the element has been clicked.

oncontextmenu

Called when a context menu is invoked generally by right-click. Can be
fired by direct targeting of the element or the event bubbling up.

ondblclick

Indicates that the element has been double-clicked.

ondrag

Fires as a draggable element is being dragged around the screen.

ondragend

Occurs at the very end of the drag-and-drop action (should be after ondrag).

ondragenter

Fires when an item being dragged passes on the element with this event
handler—in other words, when the dragged item enters into a drop zone.

ondragleave

Fires when an item being dragged leaves the element with this event
handler—in other words, when the dragged item leaves a potential drop zone.

ondragover

Fires when an object that is being dragged is over some element with this
handler.

ondragstart

Occurs on the very start of a drag-and-drop action.

ondrop

Fires when an object being dragged is released on some drop zone.

ondurationchange

Fires when the value indicating the duration of a media element changes.

onemptied

Fires when a media element goes into an uninitialized or emptied state,
potentially due to some form of a resource reset.

onended

Fires when a media element’s playback has ended because the end of the
data resource has been reached.

onerror

Used to capture various events generally related to communication using
Ajax, though may apply to arbitrary URL loading using media elements like
images, audio, and video. This attribute is also used for catching scriptrelated errors.

NOTE Listings of attributes and events defined by browser versions assume that these attributes

and events generally remain associated with later versions of that browser. For example,
attributes defined by Internet Explorer 4 are valid for Internet Explorer 5 and higher, and
attributes defined for Netscape 4 remain valid for Netscape browsers as well as Firefox. Safari
information focuses on Safari 2 and 3. The Google Chrome browser is not always directly called
out in this book, but, given its reliance on the WebKit engine, you should assume Safari entries
will apply to this browser. Compatibility pre-Opera 4 is determined via research not testing; in
cases of uncertainity we assume support from Opera 4. Of course, reasonably this is more for
historical accuracy and will simply not affect modern Web developers.

Examples
<!-- This is an informational comment that can occur
anywhere in an HTML document. The next few examples
show how style sheets and scripts are "commented out" to prevent
older browsers from misinterpreting the content.

Notes
• Comments often are used to exclude content from older browsers, particularly those
that do not understand client-side scripting or style sheets.
• Page developers should be careful when commenting markup to ensure that other
comments are not included or that two dashes (--) are not embedded in the content
commented.

The expression language supported by conditional comments is relatively simple, consisting
of browser type and version identifier, less-than and greater-than operators, and basic
Boolean operators. The syntax is briefly overviewed in Table 3-7.

number

An integer or floating-point value corresponding to the version of the browser.

true

The Boolean constant value of true.

false

The Boolean constant value of false.

lt

Less-than operator; returns true if the first argument is less than the second argument.

Notes
• The <!DOCTYPE> statement should be used as the first line of all documents.
• Validation programs might use this construct when determining the correctness of
an HTML document.
• While HTML5 does not follow the SGML/XML concept of validation, the
<!DOCTYPE> is still used. HTML5 does however provide for syntax checking
currently dubbed conformance checking. Note though that conformance checking
does not rely on XML/SGML grammar.
• Modern browsers may determine what rendering mode to use depending on the
<!DOCTYPE> statement. This is dubbed the doctype switch. An incorrect <!DOCTYPE>
that does not correspond to appropriate markup usage may result in inaccurate
display.

Element-Specific Attributes
charset This attribute defines the character encoding of the linked resource. The value is a
space- and/or comma-delimited list of character sets as defined in RFC 2045.

coords For use with object shapes, this attribute uses a comma-separated list of numbers to
define the coordinates of the object on the page.

href This is the single required attribute for anchors defining a hypertext source link. It

indicates the link target—either a URL or a URL fragment, which is a name preceded by a
hash mark (#) specifying an internal target location within the current document. URLs are
not restricted to Web-based (http) documents. URLs might use any protocol supported by
the browser. For example, file, ftp, and mailto work in most user agents.

hreflang This attribute is used to indicate the language of the linked resource and should

be set to whichever language is specified in the core lang attribute. Browsers will likely not
annotate links appropriately with language information, but style sheet rules using attribute
selectors could be used to do this.

media

The draft HTML5 specification suggests the value should be used to indicate
whether a destination is appropriate for screen, print, PDA, and so on. This is an advisory
property and does not restrict action.

methods The value of this attribute provides information about the functions that might be
performed on an object. The values generally are given by the HTTP protocol when it is
used; as for the title attribute, it might be useful to include advisory information in
advance in the link. For example, the browser might choose a different rendering of a link as
a function of the methods specified; something that is searchable might get a different icon,
or an outside link might render with an indication of leaving the current site. This attribute
is neither well understood nor supported, even by the defining browser, Internet Explorer.
name This attribute is required in an anchor defining a target location within a page. A value

for name is similar to a value for the id core attribute, and it should be an alphanumeric
identifier unique to the document. Under the HTML and XHTML specifications, id and name
both can be used with an <a> tag as long as they have identical values. HTML5 directly states
page authors should not use name even though it may be supported in browsers and id
values should be used instead.

ping This HTML5–specific attribute is used to specify the URL(s) that will be notified
when a link is activated. If more than a single URL is specified, the addresses should be
separated by spaces. Despite some early Firefox dablings with this attribute by late 2009, no
browser implements this feature, and privacy concerns about this attribute may keep it
from ever being widely adopted.
rel For anchors containing the href attribute, this attribute specifies the relationship of the
target object to the link object. The value is a comma-separated list of relationship values.
The values and their semantics will be registered by some authority that might have
meaning to the document author. The default relationship, if no other is given, is void. The
rel attribute should be used only when the href attribute is present. Table 3-8 lists possible
rel values defined in HTML5 for <a> tags.
rev This attribute specifies a reverse link, the inverse relationship of the rel attribute. It is
useful for indicating where an object came from, such as the author of a document.
shape This attribute is used to define a selectable region for hypertext source links
associated with a figure in order to create an image map. The values for the attribute are
circle, default, polygon, and rect. The format of the coords attribute depends on the
value of shape. For circle, the value is x,y,r, where x and y are the pixel coordinates for
the center of the circle and r is the radius value in pixels. For rect, the coords attribute
should be x,y,w,h. The x,y values define the upper-left corner of the rectangle, while w and h
define the width and height, respectively. A value of polygon for shape requires
x1,y1,x2,y2,… values for coords. Each of the x,y pairs defines a point in the polygon, with
successive points being joined by straight lines and the last point joined to the first. The value
of default for shape requires that the entire enclosed area, typically an image, be used.

NOTE It is advisable to use the usemap attribute for the img element and the associated map
element to define hotspots instead of the shape attribute.

target

This attribute specifies the target window for a hypertext source link that references
frames. The information linked to target will be displayed in the named window. Frames
and windows must be named to be targeted if they do not correspond to a special name
value, which include _blank, which indicates a new window; _parent, which indicates the
parent frame set containing the source link; _self, which indicates the frame containing the
source link; and _top, which indicates the full browser window.

type This attribute specifies the media type in the form of a MIME type for the link target.
Generally, this is provided strictly as advisory information; however, in the future a browser
might add a small icon for multimedia types. For example, a browser might add a small
speaker icon when type is set to audio/wav. For a complete list of recognized MIME types,
see www.w3.org/TR/html4/references.html#ref-MIMETYPES.
urn This supposedly Internet Explorer–supported attribute has some origins in HTML 3.2
and it relates a uniform resource name (URN) with the link. While it is based on standards
work going years back, the meaning of URNs is still not well defined nor has it been
demonstrated that this attribute does anything despite its occurrence in MSDN
documentation.

Notes
• This tag is commonly confused with <acronym>. Debate about just what constitutes
an acronym as compared with an abbreviation is common among very detail-oriented
Web standards experts. While Web developers appear to use an <acronym> tag more
often than an <abbr> tag, the former is deprecated under HTML5! The confusion
continues.
• When the title attribute is set on this element, browsers may render a dotted
underline, which is useful to indicate the presence of a tooltip that might contain the
expansion for the abbreviation.

• According to the HTML5 specification, the title attribute should be set to the
expansion of the abbreviation.
• The disabled attribute is not currently documented for this element at MSDN,
though it continues to work in Internet Explorer browsers.
• The MSDN documentation for this element may have errors regarding the extent of
its event support, because many events that are not listed as supported actually
worked when tested.
• Because there is typically no markup-oriented presentation for this element, it is
primarily used in conjunction with style sheets and scripts.

Element-Specific Attributes
alt This attribute causes a descriptive text alternative to be displayed in browsers that do
not support Java. Web designers should also remember that content enclosed within an

<applet> tag may also be rendered as alternative text.

archive

This attribute refers to the URL of an archived or compressed version of the applet
and its associated class files, which might help reduce download time.

code This attribute specifies the URL of the applet’s class file to be loaded and executed.

Applet filenames are identified by a .class filename extension. The URL specified by code
might be relative to the codebase attribute.

codebase This attribute gives the absolute or relative URL of the directory where applets’
.class files referenced by the code attribute are stored.

mayscript In the Netscape implementation, this attribute allows access to an applet by a
scripting language.

Chapter 3:

name This attribute assigns a name to the applet so that it can be identified by other
resources, particularly scripts.

src As defined for Internet Explorer 4 and higher, this attribute specifies a URL for an
associated file for the applet. Its meaning and use are unclear and it is not part of the HTML
standard.

Example
<applet code="atarigame.class" align="left" archive="game.zip"

Notes
• The W3C specification does not encourage the use of <applet> and prefers the use
of the <object> tag. Under the strict definition of HTML 4.01, this element is
deprecated and it is cited as obsolete under HTML5, though currently it still appears
in many versions of the specification. Despite the strong desire of standard bodies to
remove this from common use, it is still often used.
• The HTML 4 specification does not show event-handling attributes for this element,
though you may find that they work. However, given that an applet may include an
interactive object, the sense of capturing events with it as compared to within the
applet can be a bit confusing.

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

Element-Specific Attributes
alt This attribute contains a text string alternative to display in browsers that cannot
display images.

coords This attribute contains a set of values specifying the coordinates of the hotspot

region. The number and meaning of the values depend upon the value specified for the

shape attribute. For a rect or rectangle shape, the coords value is two x,y pairs: left,
top, right, and bottom. For a circ or circle shape, the coords value is x,y,r, where x,y
is a pair specifying the center of the circle and r is a value for the radius. For a poly or
polygon shape, the coords value is a set of x,y pairs for each point in the polygon:

x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3, and so on.

href This attribute specifies the hyperlink target for the area. Its value is a valid URL.
Either this attribute or the nohref attribute must be present in the element.

hreflang This attribute, introduced by HTML5, is used to indicate the language of the

linked resource in an image map and should be set to whichever language is specified in
the core lang attribute. Browsers will likely not annotate links appropriately with language
information, but style sheet rules using attribute selectors could be used to do this. The
absence of this attribute in previous HTML versions is a clear oversight.

media This HTML5 attribute specifies the media format the link destination was defined
for. It is advisory information, and the value should be used to suggest if a destination is
appropriate for screen, print, PDA, and so on.

name This attribute is used to define a name for the clickable area so that it can be scripted
by older browsers.
nohref This attribute indicates that no hyperlink exists for the associated area. Either this
attribute or the href attribute must be present in the element. Under XHTML, this attribute
will have a value of "nohref"; under standard HTML, no value is required.
ping This HTML5–specific attribute is used to specify the URL(s) that will be notified
when a link is activated. If more than a single URL is specified, the addresses should be
separated by spaces. Circa early 2009, no browser implements this feature, and privacy
concerns about this attribute may keep it from ever being widely adopted.
rel HTML5 introduces this attribute to specify link relationships on image maps. The lack

of this attribute in previous specifications was clearly an oversight. For image map areas
containing the href attribute, this attribute specifies the relationship of the target object to the
link object. The value is a comma-separated list of relationship values. The values and their
semantics will be registered by some authority that might have meaning to the document
author. The default relationship, if no other is given, is void. The rel attribute should be used
only when the href attribute is present because it makes no sense with nohref.

shape This attribute defines the shape of the associated hot spot. HTML 4 defines the
values rect, which defines a rectangular region; circle, which defines a circular region;
poly, which defines a polygon; and default, which indicates the entire region beyond any
defined shapes. Many browsers, notably Internet Explorer 4 and higher, support alternate
values for shapes, including circ, polygon, and rectangle.
target

This attribute specifies the target window for hyperlink-referencing frames. The
value is a frame name or one of several special names. A value of _blank indicates a new
window. A value of _parent indicates the parent frame set containing the source link.
A value of _self indicates the frame containing the source link. A value of _top indicates
the full browser window.

type This attribute specifies the media type in the form of a MIME type for the link target.
Generally, this is provided strictly as advisory information; however, in the future a browser
might add a small icon for multimedia types. For example, a browser might add a small
speaker icon when type is set to audio/wav. For a complete list of recognized MIME types,
see www.w3.org/TR/html4/references.html#ref-MIMETYPES. The attribute is commonly
understood for the a element but was introduced by HTML5 to image maps.

Examples
<map id="primary" name="primary">
<area shape="circle" coords="200,250,25" href="another.html">
<area shape="default" nohref>
</map>
<!-- XHTML syntax -->
<map id="secondary" name="secondary">
<area shape="rect" coords="10,10,100,100" href="another.html" />
<area shape="default" nohref="nohref" />
</map>

Compatibility
HTML 2, 3.2, 4, 4.01, 5
XHTML 1.0, 1.1

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 2+,
Netscape 1+, Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• As an empty element under XHTML or when using XML-style syntax for HTML5,
a trailing slash is required for this element: <area />.
• HTML5 does not define rev attribute for <area> tags.
• Netscape 1–level browsers do not understand the target attribute as it relates to
frames.
• HTML 3.2 defines only alt, coords, href, nohref, and shape.

PART I

This HTML5 block element defines a subset of a document’s content that forms an
independent part of the document, such as a blog post, article, or other self-contained
unit of information, that may be linked to or included in some other content body.

176

Part I:

Core Markup

<p>The new HTML5 specification is in the works. While many features are
not currently implemented or even well defined yet, progress is being made.
Stay tuned to see more new HTML elements added to your Web documents in the
years to come.</p>
</article>
<p>There are other things in this page.</p>

Compatibility
HTML5

Not currently supported by any browser, but can be addressed with a custom element.

Notes
• Early versions of this tag supported pubdate and cite attributes but these were
removed later in favor of nested <time> tags.
• It is possible to nest <article> tags and the relationship should logically relate to
the parent <article> subject matter.
• This element is not directly implemented in any browser. However, given that most
browsers can handle custom elements, it is easy enough to simulate the idea of it
and even apply a CSS display property for it.

<aside>

(Aside)

This HTML5 element defines a section of a document that encloses content that is
tangentially related to the other content the element may be associated with. A simple
example of this element in action might be to specify sidebar content.

HTML5 Standard Syntax
<aside

Element-Specific Attributes
autobuffer

This Boolean attribute indicates whether or not the browser should begin
buffering audio right away. It is often set when it is believed that the audio will be played.
This is valuable when autoplay is not set, but the attribute has no meaning if autoplay is
set since the browser will play the audio as soon as it can.

autoplay This Boolean attribute indicates the browser should begin playing the audio as
soon after page load once it has loaded enough of the audio to avoid pausing.
controls This Boolean attribute is set to indicate whether or not the browser should present
the controls for audio, such as playback, pause, volume, and seek. If not present, no controls
will be shown and it will be up to the developer to script the control of the media playback.
When no controls are present, the audio element will not be visually presented.
loop This Boolean attribute, if present, indicates that the audio should loop.
src

This attribute is set to the URL of the audio to show.

Examples
<audio src="music.ogg" autoplay>
<p>No support for HTML5 <code>audio</code> element.</p>
</audio>
<audio src="music.ogg" loop controls>
<p>No support for HTML5 <code>audio</code> element.</p>
</audio>

<!-- Trick to make sound in IE browsers -->
<audio src="music.wav">
<bgsound src="music.wav">
</audio>

Compatibility
HTML5

Firefox 3.5+, Safari 3.1+

Notes
• Alternate content should be placed inside of the audio element for browsers that do
not support it.
• Having the correct MIME types on hosted media files is key for playback. You
should also make sure the media types used work in the browsers targeted, because
currently this varies even when the audio element is supported.
• Flash will often be used to avoid cross-browser audio concerns. Until this element is
widely supported, developers are advised to continue to use Flash or to rely on
elements like bgsound.

Part I:

Core Markup

Element-Specific Attributes
href This attribute specifies the base URL to be used throughout the document for relative
URL addresses.

target

For documents containing frames, this attribute specifies the default target window
for every link that does not have an explicit target reference. Aside from named frames or
windows, several special values exist. A value of _blank indicates a new window. A value
of _parent indicates the parent frame set containing the source link. A value of _self
indicates the frame containing the source link. A value of _top indicates the full browser
window.

Examples
<!-- standard HTML syntax --->
<base href="http://www.htmlref.com/">
<-- XHTML syntax -->
<base href="http://www.htmlref.com/" />
<!-- with frames -->
<base target="_blank" href="http://www.htmlref.com/">

Compatibility
HTML 2, 3.2, 4, 4.01, 5
XHTML 1.0, 1.1, Basic

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 2+,
Netscape 1+, Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• This element should only occur within the head element.
• HTML 2.0 and 3.2 define only the href attribute.
• Under XHTML variants and HTML5 using XML-syntax, this empty element requires
a trailing slash: <base />.
• HTML5’s current draft specification specifies all common attributes and events, but
frankly many of these make little sense for this element. HTML 4 did not define
them for good reason, so it is likely this may be modified back to a syntax closer to
that of the HTML 4 specification.

<basefont>

(Base Font)

This element establishes a default font size for a document. Font size then can be varied
relative to the base font size by using the font element.

Standard Syntax (Transitional Only)
<basefont
color="color name | #RRGGBB"
face="font name(s)"
id="unique alphanumeric identifier"
size="1-7 | +/-int">

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

183

Attributes Defined by Internet Explorer
id="unique alphanumeric identifier" (4)

onlayoutcomplete, onmouseenter, onmouseleave, onreadystatechange

Element-Specific Attributes
color This attribute sets the text color using either a named color or a color specified in the
hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.

face This attribute contains a list of one or more font names. The document text in the

default style is rendered in the first font face that the client’s browser supports. If no font
listed is installed on the local system, the browser typically defaults to the proportional or
fixed-width font for that system.

size This attribute specifies the font size as either a numeric or relative value. Numeric
values range from 1 to 7, with 1 being the smallest and 3 the default. Relative values start
with + or –, followed by a digit, and modify the current size appropriately. Resulting values
above 7 become 7 and below 1 become 1.

Example
<!-- Standard HTML syntax -->
<basefont color="#ff0000" face="Helvetica" size="+2">
<!-- XHTML style syntax -->
<basefont color="#ff0000" face="Helvetica" size="+2" />

Compatibility
HTML 2, 3.2, 4, 4.01 (transitional)
XHTML 1.0 (transitional)

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 2+,
Netscape 1+, Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• HTML 3.2 supports the basefont element but only with the size attribute.
• The (X)HTML strict and HTML5 specifications do not support this element.
• This element can be imitated with a CSS rule on the body element.
• Transitional XHTML 1.0 requires a trailing slash for this empty element:
<basefont />.

Element-Specific Attributes
balance This attribute defines a number between –10,000 and +10,000 that determines how
the volume will be divided between the speakers.

loop This attribute indicates the number of times a sound is to be played and has either a
positive numeric value or –1 to specify that it will continuously loop. The keyword
infinite is also supported in many Internet Explorer implementations.

Core Markup

src This attribute specifies the URL of the sound file to be played, which must be one of
the following types: .wav, .au, or .mid.
volume This attribute defines a number between –10,000 and 0 that determines the

loudness of a page’s background sound. Oddly, 0 is full volume and –10,000 is none.

Examples
<!-- assume examples are in different pages -->
<bgsound src="sound1.mid">
<bgsound src="sound2.au" loop="infinite">
<bgsound src="sound3.wav" loop="3" volume="-2000">

Compatibility
No standards support

Internet Explorer 2+, Opera 4+

Notes
• Similar functionality can be achieved in older versions of Netscape using the
<embed> tag to invoke an audio player as well as using HTML5’s <audio> tag in
supporting browsers.
• You could write bgsound with a self-closing tag <bgsound />. However, since this
element is not part of a standard, making it XHTML-like will not make it validate.

Notes
• This element was originally introduced in HTML 3 and moved to HTML 3.2.
• The effect of this element is easily mimicked using the CSS rule font-size:
larger or under older browsers using <font size="+1">.
• Although HTML5 marks this element as obsolete, interestingly, it currently doesn’t
mark the small element as such but rather recasts its meaning instead. With the
strict (X)HTML variants supporting this element, this element’s status may change.

Element-Specific Attributes
alink This attribute sets the color for active links within the document. Active links

represent the state of a link as it is being clicked. The value of the attribute can be either a
named color like red or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format like
#FF0000. The CSS pseudo-class a:active should be used instead.

background This attribute contains a URL for an image file, which will be tiled to provide

the document background. The CSS background-image property should be used instead.

bgcolor This attribute sets the background color for the document. Its value can be either a
named color like red or a color specified using the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format like
#FF0000. The CSS background-color property should be used instead.

bgproperties This attribute, first introduced in Internet Explorer 2, has one value, fixed,

which causes the background image to act as a fixed watermark and not to scroll. The CSS
property background-attachment provides similar functionality.

Part I:

Core Markup

bottommargin This attribute specifies the bottom margin for the entire body of the page and
overrides the default margin. When set to 0 or "", the bottom margin is the bottom edge of
the window or frame the content is displayed in. CSS margin properties should be used
instead.
leftmargin This Internet Explorer–specific attribute sets the left margin for the page, in
pixels, overriding the default margin. When set to 0 or "", the left margin is the left edge of
the window or the frame. CSS margin properties should be used instead.
link This attribute sets the color for hyperlinks within the document that have not yet been
visited. Its value can be either a browser-dependent named color or a color specified using
the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format. The CSS pseudo-class a:link should be used instead.

marginheight This Netscape-specific attribute sets the top margin for the document, in
pixels. If set to 0 or "", the top margin will be exactly on the top edge of the window or
frame. It is equivalent to combining the Internet Explorer attributes bottommargin and
topmargin. CSS margin properties should be used instead.
marginwidth This Netscape-specific attribute sets the left and right margins for the page, in
pixels, overriding the default margin. When set to 0 or "", the left margin is the left edge of
the window or the frame. It is equivalent to combining the Internet Explorer attributes
leftmargin and rightmargin. CSS margin properties should be used instead.
nowrap This Internet Explorer–specific attribute is used to control the wrapping of text
body width. If set to yes, text should not wrap. The default is no.
rightmargin This Internet Explorer–specific attribute sets the right margin for the page in
pixels, overriding the default margin. When set to 0 or "", the right margin is the right edge
of the window or the frame. CSS margin properties should be used instead.
scroll This Internet Explorer–specific attribute turns the scroll bars on or off. The default
value is yes.
text This attribute sets the text color for the document. Its value can be either a named
color like red or a color specified using the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format. The CSS
property color should be used on the body element instead of this attribute.
topmargin This Internet Explorer–specific attribute sets the top margin for the document, in
pixels. If set to 0 or "", the top margin will be exactly on the top edge of the window or
frame. CSS margin properties should be used instead.
vlink This attribute sets the color for hyperlinks within the document that have already
been visited. Its value can be either a browser-dependent named color or a color specified
using the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format. The CSS pseudo-class a:visited should be used
instead.

Notes
• When defining text colors, it is important to be careful to specify both foreground
and background explicitly so that they are not masked out by browser defaults set
by the user.
• Under the strict HTML and XHTML definitions as well as HTML5, CSS should be
used in place of presentation attributes like alink, background, bgcolor, link,
text, and vlink.
• This element must be present in all documents except those declaring a frame set.
• Under XHTML, the closing </body> tag is mandatory.
• HTML5 returns to the old style of making the element optional.
• HTML5 currently defines all common attributes for this element, though the meaning
of some in the context of the entire document is a bit unclear.

Element-Specific Attributes
clear This attribute forces the insertion of vertical space so that the tagged text can be
positioned with respect to images. A value of left clears text that flows around left-aligned
images to the next full left margin; a value of right clears text that flows around right-aligned
images to the next full right margin; and a value of all clears text until it can reach both full
margins. The default value according to the transitional HTML and XHTML specifications is
none, but its meaning generally is supported as just introducing a return and nothing more.
The CSS clear property is preferred over using this attribute.

Notes
• This is an empty element. A closing tag is illegal under all HTML specifications. For
XHTML compatibility, a closing slash is required: <br />.
• Under the strict (X)HTML specifications and HTML5, the clear attribute is not valid.
The CSS property clear provides the same functionality as the clear attribute.

Chapter 3:

• Many developers opt to use margin-related CSS properties to perform the course
formatting duties that this element performed. It is arguable that degradation in the
absence of style sheets may actually favor the br element’s continued use.

Element-Specific Attributes
autofocus This HTML5 Boolean attribute is used to indicate that the user agent should
immediately focus this form item once its containing window object (usually the document)
is made active. It takes an attribute value of autofocus when using the XML-style syntax
for XHTML5.
form This HTML5 attribute should be set to a string that corresponds to the id of the form
element that the button is associated with. This allows form elements in one form to trigger
actions in others.
formaction This HTML5 attribute specifies a URL to target when the button is clicked,
similar to the use of the action attribute on a form element.

formenctype Under HTML5 this attribute is set to the MIME type for how data should be
transmitted to the URL specified in the action attribute. Common values include

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

197

application/x-www-form-urlencoded (the default value when not specified),
multipart/formdata, and text/plain.

formnovalidate This HTML5 Boolean attribute is used to indicate a form should not be

validated during submission. It is false by default but may be controlled either on the
button directly or on a containing or related form. Initially this was simply known as
novalidate.

formtarget This HTML5 attribute is set to the name of a window or frame that the button
action will target the result of action, similar to the target attribute on <a> and <form>
tags. Initially, this attribute was simply target in early drafts of HTML5.
name This attribute is used to define a name for the button so that it can be scripted by
older browsers or used to provide a name for submit buttons when a page has more than
one. The id attribute is preferred for scripting purposes.
type This attribute defines the action of the button. Possible values include button, reset,
and submit, which are used to indicate that the button is a plain button, form reset button,
or form submission button, respectively. The XHTML specification indicates submit is the
default, but browsers may not enforce this in practice.
value
This attribute defines the value that is sent to the server when the button is clicked. This
might be useful when using multiple submit buttons that perform different actions, to
indicate to the handling server-side program which button was clicked.

Examples
<button name="Submit"
value="Submit"
type="Submit">Submit Request</button>
<button type="button"
onclick="doSomething();">Click This Button</button>
<button type="button">
<img src="polkadot.gif" alt="Polkadot"></button>

Compatibility
HTML 4, 4.01, 5
XHTML 1.0, 1.1

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 4+,
Netscape 6+, Opera 5+, Safari 1+

PART I

formmethod This HTML5 attribute indicates how form information should be transferred
to the server using a particular HTTP method. A get value in the attribute indicates that
form data should be appended to the URL specified by the action attribute creating a
query string. This approach is quite simple but imposes a size limitation that is difficult to
gauge (may be as low as 2 kilobytes or even ~300 characters in real situations). A value of
post for this attribute transfers the data of the form in the message body using the HTTP
POST method, which imposes no data size limitation. Browsers may allow for other HTTP
methods like delete or put, as suggested by the HTML5 specification, but so far such
usage is rare. The post value must be used when file attachments are used in a form.

198

Part I:

Core Markup

Notes
• It is not appropriate to associate an image map with an <img> tag that appears as
the content of a button element.
• HTML5 may eventually add new values to the type attribute. Already many new
type values have been proposed in different forums, such as add, remove, move-up,
and move-down. These may produce predefined button styles, including icons in
some user agents, but so far their inclusion is far from certain.
• The HTML 4.01 specification reserves the data-binding attributes datafld,
dataformatas, and datasrc for future use. Internet Explorer does support them.
• The default type of a <button> is submit under Internet Explorer 8’s standards
mode, and is button under IE 8’s compatibility mode.
• Under Internet Explorer 8, the value of a submitted button depends on the
compatibility mode of the browser. In IE 8 standards mode, the contents of the
attribute value is sent, as compared to IE 8 compatibility mode, where the
innerText value of the <button> tag used is sent.

<canvas>

(Canvas for Drawing)

This element defines a region in the document to be used as a bitmap canvas where script
code can be used to render graphics interactively. It should be noted that the markup syntax
of this element is a relatively minor portion of what is required to effectively utilize the
drawing technology found within.

Example

lineCap

Sets the type of endings that are put on lines. The
choices are butt, round, and square. A value
of butt indicates that there is a flat edge at the
end of the specified line. A value of round adds
a semicircle with a diameter the width of the line
to the end of the line. A value of square adds a
rectangle with a width half of the line’s width and
a length equal to the line’s width at the end of the
line. The default is butt.

context.lineCap =
"round";

lineJoin

Sets the type of corners that occur when two
lines meet. The choices are miter, bevel, and
round. On all joins, a filled triangle connecting the
two lines is connected. A value of bevel uses only
this filled triangle. A value of miter indicates that
in addition to the triangle, a second filled triangle
is created. The second triangle consists of a line
that connects the two lines as well as the two lines
themselves extended until they meet. A value of
round indicates that corners should be rounded
when lines meet. The arc has a diameter equal to
the width of the line. The default is miter.

context.lineJoin =
"round";

lineWidth

Sets the width of the lines. The default value is 1.

context.lineWidth = 5;

miterLimit

Sets the max length that a line will be extended if
lineJoin is set to miter. If the length necessary
to join the lines is greater than the miterLimit,
the join will not occur. The default is 10.

Notes
• When this element was initially introduced in 2004 by Apple, it caused some degree
of controversy in the Web community because developers assumed that it would
open the floodgates to vendor-specific extensions.
• Under some Safari implementations, the close </canvas> tag is not required or
understood.

Part I:

Core Markup

• User agents that do not understand <canvas> should render the contents of the
element instead.
• It is possible to simulate the <canvas> tag under Internet Explorer using one of
numerous libraries such as Google’s ExplorerCanvas (http://excanvas.sourceforge
.net/). Such libraries rely on the use of IE’s proprietary VML (Vector Markup
Language) technology and are likely going to operate slowly given the required
translation as compared to a native <canvas> implementation.
• Chapter 2 has a discussion of <canvas> and its use with JavaScript.

Element-Specific Attributes
align This attribute specifies the alignment of the caption. HTML 4 defines bottom, left,

right, and top as legal values. Internet Explorer also supports center. Because this
attribute does not provide the possibility to combine vertical and horizontal alignments,
Microsoft has introduced the valign attribute for the caption element.

valign This Internet Explorer–specific attribute specifies whether the table caption appears
at the top or bottom. The default is top.

<table border="1">
<caption align="top">Our High-Priced Menu</caption>
<tr>
<td>Escargot</td>
<td>Filet Mignon</td>

Notes
• The center element defined by the W3C is a shorthand notation for <div
align="center">. The content model for this element is odd, as the <center> tag
is often found enclosing large sections of content or fragments. Typically, it has been
noted that page authors who tend to use the element don’t care about the content
model and use tags out of context freely.
• The strict versions of HTML and XHTML do not include the center element, but it
is easily imitated with the text-align CSS property.
• HTML5 defines the center element as obsolete.
• HTML 3.2 does not support any attributes for this element.

Element-Specific Attributes
bgcolor This Internet Explorer–specific attribute sets the background color for the column.
Its value can be either a browser-dependent named color or a color specified using the
hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.

char This attribute is used to set the character on which the cells in a column should be
aligned. A typical value for this is a period (.) for aligning numbers or monetary values.

PART I

Attributes Introduced by HTML5

216

Part I:

Core Markup

charoff This attribute is used to indicate the number of characters by which the column
data should be offset from the alignment characters specified by the char value.
span When present, this attribute applies the attributes of the col element to additional
consecutive columns.

valign This attribute specifies the vertical alignment of the text within the cell. Possible
values for this attribute are baseline, bottom, middle, and top.

width This attribute specifies a default width for each column in the current column group.
In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values, this attribute might take the special
form 0*, which means that the width of each column in the group should be the minimum
width necessary to hold the column’s contents. Relative widths, such as 0.5*, also can be
used.

Example
<table border="1" width="400">
<colgroup>
<col align="center" width="150" />
<col align="right" />
</colgroup>
<td>This column is aligned to the center.</td>
<td>This one is aligned to the right.</td>
</td>
<tr><td>!</td><td>?</td></tr>
<tr><td>!</td><td>?</td></tr>
</table>

Compatibility

XHTML 1.0, 1.1

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 4+,
Netscape 6+, Opera 7+, Safari 1+

Notes
• Under XHTML 1.0 and XHTML5, <col> requires a trailing slash: <col />.
• This element should appear within a colgroup element, and, like that element, it is
somewhat of a convenience feature used to set attributes with one or more table
columns. In practice, few developers seem to use it.

<colgroup>

(Table Column Group)

This element creates an explicit group of table columns containing col elements to provide
for table column-level scripting or formatting.

Standard Syntax
<colgroup

Element-Specific Attributes
align This attribute specifies horizontal alignment of the contents of the cells in the column

group. The values of center, left, and right have obvious meanings. A value of justify
for the attribute attempts to justify all the column’s contents. A value of char attempts to
align the contents based on the value of the char attribute in conjunction with charoff.

bgcolor This Internet Explorer–specific attribute sets the background color for the columns
in the column group. Its value can be either a browser-dependent named color or a color
specified using the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.

char This attribute is used to set the character on which the cells in a column should be

aligned. A typical value for this attribute is a period (.) for aligning numbers or monetary
values.

charoff This attribute is used to indicate the number of characters by which the column
data should be offset from the alignment characters specified by the char value.
span When present, this attribute specifies the default number of columns in this group.
Browsers should ignore this attribute if the current column group contains one or more

<col> tags. The default value of this attribute is 1.

valign This attribute specifies the vertical alignment of the contents of the cells within the
column group.

width This attribute specifies a default width for each column and its cells in the current
column group. In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values, this attribute can
take the special form 0*, which means that the width of each column in the group should be
the minimum width necessary to hold the column’s contents.

Examples
<colgroup span="2" align="char" char=":" valign="center">
<col /><col /><col />
</colgroup>
<colgroup style="background-color: green;">
<col align="left" />
<col align="center" />
</colgroup>

Compatibility
HTML 4, 4.01, 5
XHTML 1.0, 1.1

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 4+,
Netscape 6+, Opera 7+, Safari 1+

Notes
• Each column group defined by a <colgroup> tag can contain zero or more <col>
tags.
• Under XHTML 1.0, the closing </colgroup> tag is mandatory.

Notes
• It is better to use standard <!--. . .--> comment rather than this tag.
• Because the comment element is not supported by all browsers, commented text
done in this fashion will appear in other browsers.

<datalist>

(List of Prefill Data)

This HTML5 element contains option elements that populate an input element with

Notes
• Under HTML specifications, including HTML5, the closing tag for this element is
optional, though using it is encouraged when it will help make the list more
understandable.
• Under XHTML 1.0, the closing </dd> tag is mandatory.
• This element occurs within a list of defined terms enclosed by a <dl> tag. Typically
associated with it is the term it defines, indicated by the <dt> tag that precedes it,
though it doesn’t have to match because there are not correspondence requirements
for definition lists.
• Under HTML5, this element has an overloaded meaning and may also be used to
enclose the content within <details> and <figure> tags.
• In early versions of HTML5, this element occurred within a <dialog> tag for
indication of dialog.
• HTML 2 and 3.2 define no attributes for this element.

<del> (Deleted Text)

Core Markup

NOTE MSDN documentation for this element appears incorrect for event handlers. Not all core

events are listed, but during testing they all worked. Other extended events like onbeforecopy,
oncopy, oncontextmenu, and more were also verified as functional under Internet Explorer 8.

Element-Specific Attributes
cite The value of this attribute is a URL that designates a source document or message that
might explain why the information was deleted.
datetime This attribute is used to indicate the date and time the deletion was made. The value
of the attribute is a date in a special format as defined by ISO 8601. The basic date format is
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD

where the following is true:
YYYY=four-digit year such as 1999
MM=two-digit month (01=January, 02=February, and so on.)
DD=two-digit day of the month (01 through 31)
hh=two-digit hour (00 to 23) (24-hour clock, not AM or PM)
mm=two-digit minute (00 through 59)
ss=two-digit second (00 through 59)
TZD=time zone designator

The time zone designator is either Z, which indicates Universal Time Coordinate or
coordinated universal time format (UTC), or +hh:mm, which indicates that the time is a local
time that is hh hours and mm minutes ahead of UTC. Alternatively, the format for the time
zone designator could be –hh:mm, which indicates that the local time is behind UTC. Note
that the letter T actually appears in the string, all digits must be used, and 00 values for
minutes and seconds might be required. An example value for the datetime attribute
might be 1999-10-6T09:15:00-05:00, which corresponds to October 6, 1999, 9:15 A.M.,
U.S. Eastern Standard Time.

Example
<p><del cite="http://www.democompany.com/changes/oct.html"
datetime="2008-10-06T09:15:00-05:00">
The penalty clause applies to client lateness as well.
</del> <ins>No more penalties</ins></p>

Compatibility
HTML 4, 4.01, 5
XHTML 1.0, 1.1

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 4+,
Netscape 6+, Opera 7+, Safari 1+

Notes
• Browsers can render deleted (<del>) text in a different style to show the changes
that have been made to the document. Internet Explorer renders the deleted text as
strikethrough text. Eventually, a browser could have a way to show a revision
history on a document.

• User agents that do not understand <del> or <ins> will show the information
anyway, so there is no harm in adding information—only in deleting it. Because of
the fact that <del>-enclosed text might show up, it might be wise to comment it out
within the element, as shown here:

Notes
• Because the <dir> tag is supposed to be used with short lists, the items in the list
should have a maximum width of 20 characters. This is rarely if ever respected.
• The HTML and XHTML strict specifications do not support this element, and the
HTML5 specification has marked it as obsolete and suggests using a <ul> tag
instead.
• Most browsers will not render a <dir> tag any differently from the <ul> tag.
• HTML 2 and 3.2 define only the compact attribute.
• Most browsers will not render the compact list style.
• For XHTML transitional compatibility, the compact attribute must have a value:
<dir compact="compact">.

<div>

Notes
• A <div> tag is a generic block tag and is very useful for binding scripts or styles to
an arbitrary section of a document. It complements <span>, which is used inline.
• Excessive use of <div> tags is almost as bad as excessive use of tables, particularly
when structuring page content.
• The HTML 4 specification specifies that the datafld, dataformatas, and datasrc
attributes are reserved for <div> and might be supported in the future. They were
removed from XHTML, but Internet Explorer supports them for data binding.
• Under the HTML 4.01 strict specification, the align attribute is not supported.
• HTML 3.2 supports only the align attribute.

<dl>

(Definition List)

This element encloses a list of terms and definitions. A common use for this element is to
implement a glossary.

Standard Syntax
<dl
class="class name(s)"
compact="compact" (transitional only)

PART I

nowrap This Internet Explorer–specific attribute is used to control the wrapping of text

Notes
• The items in the list comprise two parts: the term, indicated by the dt element, and
its definition, indicated by the dd element. However, there is no requirement to
match these elements, alternate them, or anything else, at least syntax-wise.
• Some page designers might use a <dl> tag or <ul> tag to create text indention.
Although this is a common practice on the Web, it is not advisable because it
confuses the meaning of the element by making it a physical layout device rather
than a list. A CSS property like margin or position should be used instead.

• HTML 2 and 3.2 support only the compact attribute for this element.
• For XHTML compatibility, the compact attribute must be expanded:
<dl compact="compact"> under the transitional form. It is deprecated under the
strict specification. In practice, regardless of whether it is indicated, the compact
attribute generally has no effect.

<dt> (Term in a Definition List or Caption in Figure or Details)
This element identifies a definition list term in a list of terms and definitions. Under
HTML5, the element is also used within <details> and <figure> tags to represent a
caption for content.

Notes
• Traditionally, this element occurs within a list of defined terms enclosed by a <dl>
tag. It is generally used in conjunction with a <dd> tag, which indicates its
definition. However, <dt> tags do not require a one-to-one correspondence with
<dd> tags.
• HTML5 overloads the meaning of this element so that it also serves as the caption of
content enclosed within <details> and <figure> tags.
• Under early drafts of HTML5,this element is also found within <dialog> tags and
defines the speakers of particular statements. When used within such tags, it must
be paired with <dd> tags in a one-to-one fashion. That syntax was eventually
dropped.
• The close tag for the element is optional under older versions of HTML as well as
HTML5, but including it is suggested, especially when it will make things clearer,
particularly with multiple-line definitions.
• Under XHTML 1.0, the closing </dt> tag is mandatory.
• HTML 2 and 3.2 support no attributes for this element.

Notes
• As a logical element, em is a prime candidate to bind style information to. For
example, to define emphasis to mean a larger font size in the Impact font instead of
italics, you might use a CSS rule like the following in a document-wide style sheet:
em {font-size: larger; font-family: Impact; font-style: normal;}

• HTML 2 and 3.2 support no attributes for this element.

Element-Specific Attributes
align This attribute controls the alignment of adjacent text with respect to the embedded
object. The default value is left.

alt This attribute indicates the text to be displayed if the embedded object cannot be
executed.

border This attribute specifies the size, in pixels, of the border around the embedded

object.

code This attribute specifies the name of the file containing the compiled Java class if the
embed element is used to include a Java applet. This is a strange alternative form of Java

inclusion documented by Microsoft.

codebase This specifies the base URL for the plug-in or potential applet in the case of the
alternative form under Internet Explorer.

name This attribute specifies a name for the embedded object, so that it can be referenced
by client-side programs in an embedded scripting language.
palette This attribute is used only on Windows systems to select the color palette used for
the plug-in and might be set to background or foreground. The default is background.

pluginspage

This attribute contains the URL of instructions for installing the plug-in
required to render the embedded object.

Part I:

src

Core Markup

This attribute specifies the URL of source content for the embedded object.

type This attribute specifies the MIME type of the embedded object. It is used by the
browser to determine an appropriate plug-in for rendering the object. It can be used instead
of the src attribute for plug-ins that have no content or that fetch it dynamically.
units This Netscape 4+–specific attribute is used to set the units for measurement for the
embedded object in pixels or as a relative em value.

vspace This attribute specifies, in pixels, the size of the top and bottom margins between
the embedded object and surrounding text.

Example
<!-- embed with a close tag -->
<embed src="testmovie.mov" height="150" width="150">
<noembed>
<img src="testgif.gif" height="150" width="150" alt="Test Image">
</noembed>
</embed>

Compatibility
No standard initially, but widely supported
HTML5

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 4+,
Netscape 2+, Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• Historically, it has been unclear whether or not the close tag for <embed> is required.
Many sites tended not to use it, and documentation is not consistent. A close </embed>
tag should be required and should surround any alternative content in a noembed
element.
• This element was supposed to be phased out in favor of the object element, but so
far its usage seems to have diminished only slightly.
• The embed element is not favored by the W3C and was dropped by (X)HTML
specifications previous to HTML5.
• Embedded objects are multimedia content files of arbitrary type that are rendered by
browser plug-ins. The type attribute uses a file’s MIME type to determine an
appropriate browser plug-in. Any attributes not defined are treated as object-specific
parameters and are passed through to the embedded object. Consult the plug-in or
object documentation to determine these.

Notes
• Grouping controls makes it easier for users to understand the purposes of the
controls while simultaneously facilitating tabbing navigation for visual user agents
and speech navigation for speech-oriented user agents. The proper use of this
element makes documents more accessible to users with disabilities.
• The full set of data-binding attributes likely needs to be bound to this element but is
missing from MSDN documentation.
• The caption for a <fieldset> tag can be defined by the legend element. There
should only be a single legend element within the element.

<figure>

(Figure)

This HTML5 element represents a group of content enclosed in a dd element, often with a
caption defined by a dt element, that can be moved away from the main flow of the
document. The way in which this element is implemented is similar to how the figures in
this book are presented—not necessarily directly adjacent to the text discussing them.

Element-Specific Attributes
color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.

face This attribute contains a list of one or more font names separated by commas. The

user agent looks through the specified font names and renders the text in the first font that
is supported.

point-size This Netscape 4–specific attribute specifies the point size of text and is used with

downloadable fonts. It is listed for historical purposes only and is easily mimicked using the

font-size CSS property.

size This attribute specifies the font size as either a numeric or relative value. Numeric
values range from 1 to 7, with 1 being the smallest and 3 the default. The relative values, +
and -, increment or decrement the font size relative to the current size. The value for
increment or decrement should range only from +1 to +6 or -1 to -6.
weight Under Netscape 4, this attribute specifies the weight of the font, with a value of 100
being lightest and 900 being heaviest. This is listed primarily for historical purposes; such
visual changes are best implemented using the font-weight CSS property.

Example
<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Helvetica, Times Roman" size="+1">
Relatively large red text in Helvetica or Times.
</font></p>

Notes
• Use of this element is not encouraged, as it is not part of strict HTML and XHTML
specifications. HTML5 defines this element as obsolete. CSS properties like
font-face, color, and font-size provide a richer way of providing the same
functionality as this element.
• Interestingly, the transitional specification for some reason does not define core
events for this element. In practice, they are supported by major browsers.
• The default text size for a document can be set using the size attribute of the
basefont element.
• The HTML 3.2 specification supports only the color and size attributes for this
element.
• HTML5 appears to define all the common attributes for this element, but does not
define those which are important to perform its stated task.

Element-Specific Attributes

action This attribute contains the URL of the server program that will process the contents
of the form. Some browsers also might support a mailto URL, which can mail the results to
the specified address. Otherwise, the delivery of the data in the form is defined by the
method attribute.
autocomplete This Microsoft proprietary attribute, introduced in Internet Explorer 5.0 and
redefined under HTML5, will automatically finish filling in information that the user has
previously input into an input field. Auto-filled information will likely be stored locally on
the end-user’s system by some program, typically the browser itself.
enctype This attribute indicates how form data should be encoded before being sent to the
server. The default is application/x-www-form-urlencoded. This encoding replaces
blank characters in the data with a plus character (+) and all other nonprinting characters
with a percent sign (%) followed by the character’s ASCII HEX representation. The
multipart/form-data option does not perform character conversion and transfers the
information as a compound MIME document. This must be used when using <input
type="file">. It also might be possible to use another encoding, such as text/plain
with a mailed form, but in general you should be cautious about changing the enctype.
method This attribute indicates how form information should be transferred to the server

using a particular HTTP method. A get value in the attribute indicates that form data
should be appended to the URL specified by the action attribute, thus creating a query
string. This approach is quite simple but imposes a size limitation that is difficult to gauge
(may be as low as 2 kilobytes in real situations). A value of post for this attribute transfers
the data of the form in the message body using the HTTP POST method which imposes no
data size limitation. Browsers may allow for other HTTP methods like delete or put as
suggested by the HTML5 specification, but so far such usage is rare. The POST method must
be used when file attachments are used in a form.

name This attribute specifies a name for the form and was traditionally used by JavaScript
or other client-side programming technologies to reference forms and their contained
elements. Since HTML 4, the core id attribute can be used instead with DOM methods such
as document.getElementById().
novalidate This HTML5 Boolean attribute determines whether or not form validation
should be applied on the elements within. By default, validation is enforced unless
overridden by this attribute on the form level or a formnovalidate attribute is found on a
form element.
target

In documents containing frames, this attribute specifies the target frame that will
display the results of a form submission. In addition to named frames, several special
values exist. The _blank value indicates a new window. The _parent value indicates

PART I

accept-charset This attribute specifies the list of character encodings for input data that
must be accepted by the server processing the form. The value is a space- or commadelimited list of character sets as defined in RFC 2045. The default value for this attribute is
the reserved value unknown.

the parent frame set containing the source link. The _self value indicates the frame
containing the source link. The _top value indicates the full browser window. HTML5 may
allow for targeting of nonframed regions of the page.

Notes
• Form content is defined using the <button>, <input>, <select>, and <textarea>
tags, as well as other HTML formatting and structuring elements. However, they
may not contain other form elements.
• Special grouping elements, such as fieldset, label, and legend, are provided to
structure form fields, but more often tags like <div> and <table> are used to
improve form layout.
• HTML 2 and 3.2 support only the action, enctype, and method attributes for the
form element.

<frame>

(Window Region)

This element defines a nameable window region, known as a frame, that can independently
display its own content.

allowtransparency This Internet Explorer–specific attribute determines whether the contents

security considerations of a Web page. Given its security implications, this attribute should
only be set if the developer is familiar with HTAs.

bordercolor

This attribute sets the color of the frame’s border using either a named color or
a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.

frameborder This attribute determines whether the frame is surrounded by an outlined
three-dimensional border. The HTML specification prefers the use of 1 for the frame border
on, and 0 for off; most browsers also acknowledge the use of no and yes.
longdesc This attribute specifies the URL of a document that contains a long description of
the frame’s content. This attribute should be used in conjunction with the title element.
marginheight This attribute sets the height, in pixels, between the frame’s content and its
top and bottom borders.
marginwidth This attribute sets the width, in pixels, between the frame’s content and its left
and right borders.
name This attribute assigns a name to the frame so that it can be the target destination of
hyperlinks as well as a possible candidate for manipulation via a script.
noresize This attribute overrides the default ability to resize frames and gives the frame a
fixed size.

scrolling This attribute determines whether the frame has scroll bars. A yes value forces
scroll bars, a no value prohibits them, and an auto value lets the browser decide. When not
specified, the default value of auto is used. Authors are recommended to leave the value as
auto. If you turn off scrolling and the contents end up being too large for the frame (due to
rendering differences, window size, and so forth), the user will not be able to scroll to see
the rest of the contents. If you turn scrolling on and the contents all fit in the frame, the
scroll bars will needlessly consume screen space. With the auto value, scroll bars appear
only when needed.
security This attribute sets the value indicating whether the source file of a frame has
security restrictions applied. The only allowed value is restricted.

src This attribute contains the URL of the contents to be displayed in the frame. If it is
absent, nothing will be loaded in the frame.

Example
<frameset rows="20%,80%">
<frame src="controls.html" name="controls" noresize scrolling="no">
<frame src="content.html" name="body">

255

Compatibility
Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 2+,
Netscape 2+, Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• XHTML 1.0 requires a trailing slash for this element: <frame />.
• A frame must be declared as part of a frame set, as set by using the <frameset> tag,
which specifies the frame’s relationship to other frames on a page. A frame set
occurs in a special HTML document, in which the frameset element replaces the
body element. Another form of frames called independent frames, or floating frames,
also is supported. Floating frames can be directly embedded in a document without
belonging to a frame set. These are defined with the iframe element.
• Many browsers do not support frames and require the use of the <noframes> tag.
• Frames introduce potential navigation difficulties; their use should be limited to
instances in which they can be shown to help navigation rather than hinder it.
• HTML5 currently does not include support for frames beyond <iframe> tags, but
even if the specification continues to avoid them, developers undoubtedly will
continue to use them.

<frameset>

(Frameset Definition)

This element is used to define the organization of a set of independent window regions,
known as frames, as defined by the frame element. This element replaces the body element
in framing documents.

Element-Specific Attributes
border This attribute sets the width, in pixels, of frame borders within the frame set.
Setting the value to 0 eliminates all frame borders. This attribute is not defined in the HTML
or XHTML specification but is widely supported.
bordercolor

This attribute sets the color for frame borders within the frame set using either
a named color or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.

cols This attribute contains a comma-delimited list that specifies the number and size of

columns contained within a set of frames. List items indicate columns from left to right.
Column size is specified in three formats, which might be mixed. A column can be assigned
a fixed width, in pixels. It also can be assigned a percentage of the available width, such as
50 percent. Finally, a column can be set to expand to fill the available space by setting the
value to *, which acts as a wildcard.

frameborder This attribute controls whether or not frame borders should be displayed.
Netscape supports no and yes values. Microsoft uses 1 and 0 as well as no and yes.
framespacing

This attribute indicates the space between frames, in pixels.

rows This attribute contains a comma-delimited list that specifies the number and size of
rows contained within a set of frames. The number of entries in the list indicates the number
of rows. Row size is specified with the same formats used for columns.

Examples
<!-- This example defines a frame set of three columns. The middle column
is 50 pixels wide. The first and last columns fill the remaining space.
-->
<frameset cols="*,50,*">
<frame src="column1.html">

Notes
• The content model says that the <frameset> tag contains one or more <frame>
tags, which are used to indicate the framed contents. A <frameset> tag also might
contain a <noframes> tag, whose contents will be displayed by browsers that do
not support frames.
• HTML5 currently does include support for frames beyond the inline frame defined
by an <iframe> tag.

Notes
• In most implementations, heading numbers correspond inversely with the six font
sizes supported by the font element. For example, <h1> corresponds to <font
size="6">. The default font size is 3. However, this approach to layout is not
encouraged, and page designers should consider using styles to set even relative
sizes. Interestingly, the HTML5 specification also clearly indicates the font size of
various headings like h1 (2em), h2 (1.5em), and so on, which is really not any
different from the relative nature of older <font> tags.
• HTML 3.2 supports only the align attribute. HTML 2 does not support any
attributes for headings.

Notes
• Under the XHTML 1.0 specification, the head element no longer can be implied, but
rather must be used in all documents and must have a close tag. Under standard,
older HTML specifications as well as HTML5, the element is actually optional.
• Often, a <meta> tag specifying the character set in play should be found as the first
child of the head element, particularly if the document’s title element contains
special characters.
• The meaning of the profile attribute is somewhat unclear, and no browsers appear
to support it in any meaningful way.
• HTML 2 and 3.2 support no attributes for this element.

<header>

(Header)

This HTML5 element represents the header section of a document or a section element it is
contained within. Like a typical document header in print, it should contain title and

PART I

• The hgroup element is used to control the HTML5 sectioning algorithm. Its primary
purpose is to collapse elements that would normally add outline entries into a
single entry. For example, when multiple headings (h1–h6) are used, they will
individually add items to the outline. By containing headings together in the
hgroup element, they form only a single entry in an outline. As demonstrated in the
preceding example, the need for this element is mostly to support subheadings.

noshade This attribute causes the rule to be rendered as a solid bar without shading.
size This attribute indicates the height, in pixels, of the rule.
width This attribute indicates how wide the rule should be, specified either in pixels or as a
percent of screen width, such as 80%.

Element-Specific Attributes
manifest This HTML5 attribute is set to the document’s application cache manifest, which
is used to describe the various components the page relies upon. It is generally used to
support offline access.

scroll This attribute is used to set whether or not scroll bars should show for the
document. The default value of auto puts in scroll bars as needed. This attribute, while
documented by Microsoft, does not appear to work properly and should be avoided.
xmlns This attribute declares a namespace for XML-based custom tags in the document.

For XHTML, this value is always http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml, though it could be
some other value in the case of some custom language or mixture of languages.

version This Internet Explorer 6–specific attribute was used to indicate the version of

HTML being used. It is no longer used because it is redundant of what is provided by the

<!DOCTYPE> statement.

Element-Specific Attributes
allowtransparency This Internet Explorer–specific attribute determines whether the content
of an <iframe> is transparent or opaque. The default value is false, which means it is
opaque.

application This Microsoft-specific attribute is used to indicate whether the contents of an

<iframe> are to be considered an HTML application (HTA). HTAs are applications that use

HTML, JavaScript, and Internet Explorer but are not limited to the typical type of security
considerations of a Web page. Given its security implications, this attribute should only be
set if the developer is familiar with HTAs.

border This attribute specifies the thickness of the border, in pixels.
bordercolor

This attribute specifies the color of the border.

frameborder This attribute determines whether the iframe is surrounded by a border. The
HTML 4 specification defines 0 to be off and 1 to be on. The default value is 1. Internet
Explorer also defines the values no and yes.
framespacing

This attribute creates additional space between the frames.

longdesc This attribute specifies the URL of a document that contains a long description of
the frame’s contents.
marginheight This attribute sets the height, in pixels, between the floating frame’s content
and its top and bottom borders.
marginwidth This attribute sets the width, in pixels, between the floating frame’s content
and its left and right borders.
name This attribute assigns a name to the floating frame so that it can be the target
destination of hyperlinks.

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

scrolling This attribute determines whether the frame has scroll bars. A yes value forces
scroll bars; a no value prohibits them. The default value is auto, in which case scroll bars
appear only as needed.
seamless This HTML5 Boolean attribute is set to make the iframe be rendered in such a
way that it appears to be part of the primary browsing context.

security This attribute sets the value indicating whether the source file of an iframe has
security restrictions applied. The only allowed value is restricted.

src This attribute contains the URL of the content to be displayed in the floating frame. If
absent, the frame is blank.

Examples
<iframe src="http://www.democompany.com" height="150" width="200"
name="FloatingFrame1">
Sorry, your browser doesn't support inline frames.

XHTML 1.0 (transitional or frameset)

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 3+,
Netscape 6+, Opera 5+, Safari 1+

Notes
• Under the HTML 4 strict specification, the iframe element is not defined. However,
under XHTML transitional and XHTML frameset, iframe is allowed. XHTML 1.1
does not allow it either. Floating frames can be imitated using the div element and
CSS positioning facilities.
• Iframes are useful for not only including content from within a site or beyond, but
also as a communication mechanism similar to Ajax.

PART I

sandbox This HTML5 attribute constrains the abilities of any iframed content. It may
contain a space-separated list of exceptions on included iframe content. Currently supported
values include allow-same-origin, allow-scripts, and allow-forms. By default, the
included content will be highly restricted, but each allow value will extend the sandbox to
allow the included content to talk to its origin domain (allow-same-origin), invoke
scripting (allow-scripts), or post forms (allow-forms).

Part I:

Core Markup

• HTML5 includes the iframe but does not include standard frames.
• When a browser does not understand an <iframe> tag, it displays the text included
within it as an alternate rendering.

<ilayer>

(Inflow Layer)

This Netscape 4–specific element allows the definition of overlapping content layers that
can be positioned, hidden or shown, rendered transparent or opaque, reordered front to
back, and nested. An inflow layer is a layer with a relative position that appears where it
would naturally occur in the document, in contrast to a general layer, which might be
positioned absolutely, regardless of its location in a document. The functionality of layers is
available using CSS positioning, and page developers are advised not to use this element. It
is presented solely for historical purposes in support of existing pages.

Element-Specific Attributes
above This attribute contains the name of the layer to be rendered above the current layer.
background This attribute contains the URL of a background image for the layer.
below This attribute contains the name of the layer to be rendered below the current layer.
bgcolor This attribute specifies a layer’s background color. Its value can be either a named
color or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.

clip This attribute specifies the clipping region or viewable area of the layer. All layer

content outside that rectangle will be rendered as transparent. The clip rectangle is defined

Chapter 3:

275

by two x,y pairs: top x, left y and bottom x, and right y. Coordinates are relative to the
layer’s origin point, 0,0, in its top-left corner.

left This attribute specifies, in pixels, the horizontal offset of the layer. The offset is relative
to its parent layer, if it has one, or to the left page margin if it does not.
name This attribute assigns to the layer a name that can be referenced by programs in a
client-side scripting language. The id attribute also can be used.
pagex This attribute specifies the horizontal position of the layer relative to the browser
window.
pagey This attribute specifies the vertical position of the layer relative to the browser
window.
src This attribute is used to set the URL of a file that contains the content to be loaded into
the layer.
top This attribute specifies, in pixels, the top offset of the layer. The offset is relative to its
parent layer, if it has one, or the top page margin if it does not.

visibility This attribute specifies whether a layer is hidden, shown, or inherits its visibility
from the layer that includes it.
width This attribute specifies a layer’s width, in pixels.
z-index This attribute specifies a layer’s stacking order relative to other layers. Position is
specified with positive integers, with 1 indicating the bottommost layer.

Example
<p>Content comes before.</p>
<ilayer name="background" bgcolor="green">
<p>Layered information goes here.</p>
</ilayer>
<p>Content comes after.</p>

Note
• Page developers are strongly encouraged not to use this element but instead use
<div> tags with CSS relative positioning. Netscape dropped this element for
browser versions 6.0 and higher. Its inclusion in this book is for support of existing
documents only.

Element-Specific Attributes
align This attribute controls the horizontal alignment of the image with respect to the page.

The default value is left. Many browsers, such as Netscape and Internet Explorer
implementations, support the absbottom, absmiddle, baseline, and texttop values. This
attribute is deprecated under strict variants of (X)HTML as well as HTML5.

alt This attribute contains a string to be displayed instead of the image for browsers that
cannot display images.

border This attribute indicates the width, in pixels, of the border surrounding the image.
HTML5 suggests the element should not be used other than to set a value of 0, as CSS
should be used instead.

278

Part I:

Core Markup

dynsrc In the Microsoft implementation, this attribute indicates the URL of a movie file and
is used instead of the src attribute. Common formats used here are .avi (Audio-Visual
Interleaved), .mov (QuickTime), and .mpg and .mpeg (Motion Picture Experts Group). Be
careful, because support of this attribute beyond Internet Explorer 6 is suspect and security
settings may restrict it.
galleryimg This Microsoft attribute is used to control whether the gallery image menu should
appear when the mouse pointer hovers over an image. The default value is true or yes. A value
of no or false suppresses the menu. A meta tag like <meta http-equiv="imagetoolbar"
content="no"> can be used to suppress the image toolbar document-wide. This attribute is
rendered obsolete in later versions of Internet Explorer (7+).
ismap This attribute indicates that the image is a server-side image map. User mouse
actions over the image are sent to the server for processing.
longdesc This attribute specifies the URL of a document that contains a long description of
the image. This attribute is used as a complement to the alt attribute.
loop In the Microsoft implementation, this attribute is used with the dynsrc attribute to
cause a movie to loop. Its value is either a numeric loop count or the keyword infinite.
Later versions of Internet Explorer suggest using –1 to indicate infinite. Since it is related to
dynsrc, the use of <img> to play movies does not work past Internet Explorer 6 unless
security settings are modified.
lowsrc

This nonstandard attribute, supported in most browsers, contains the URL of an
image to be initially loaded. Typically, the lowsrc image is a low-resolution or black-andwhite image that provides a quick preview of the image to follow. Once the primary image
is loaded, it replaces the lowsrc image.

name This common attribute is used to bind a name to the image. Older browsers
understand the name field, and, in conjunction with scripting languages, it is possible to
manipulate images by their defined names to create effects such as “rollover” buttons.
Under modern versions of HTML and XHTML, the id attribute should be used as an
element identifier for scripting and style application. The name attribute can still be used for
backward compatibility.
src This attribute indicates the URL of an image file to be displayed. Most browsers will
display .gif, .jpeg, and .png files directly. Older formats like .bmp, .xpm (X Bitmap), and
.xpm (X Pixelmap) are also commonly supported, though their use is never recommended.
Some modern browsers may support .svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) files as well with the
img element.
start In the Microsoft implementation, this attribute is used with the dynsrc attribute to
indicate when a movie should play. The default value, if no value is specified, is to play the
video as soon as it has finished loading. This can be explicitly set with a value of fileopen.
Alternatively, a value of mouseover can be set to play the move once the user has moved
their mouse over the video. This, like other dynsrc features, may not work past Internet
Explorer 6 browsers because of security changes.

usemap This attribute makes the image support client-side image mapping. Its argument is

Examples
<img src="graham.jpg" alt="Graham Allan" height="320" width="150">
<img src="olivia.jpg" lowsrc="loading.jpg" border="0" height="50%"
width="50%" alt="Picture of Olivia" longdesc="olivia-bio.html">

Notes
• Typically, when you use the usemap attribute, the URL is a fragment, such as
#map1, rather than a full URL. Some browsers do not support external client-side
map files. HTML5 makes this statement more strongly than in other specifications.
• Under the strict HTML and XHTML definitions, the <img> tag does not support
align, border, height, hspace, vspace, and width. The functionality of these
attributes should be possible using style sheet rules.
• Whereas the HTML 4 specification reserves data-binding attributes such as datafld
or datasrc for many elements, they are not specified for <img>; however, Internet
Explorer provides support for these attributes.
• As an empty element under XHTML or when using XML-style syntax for HTML5,
a trailing slash is required for this element: <img />.
• Under future versions of XHTML such as 2, <img> may be dropped in favor of
<object>.
• It should be noted that some core attributes for HTML5, most noticably
spellcheck, make little sense within the meaning of this element.

<input>

(Input Form Control)

This element specifies an input control for a form. The type of input is set by the type
attribute and can be a variety of different types, including single-line text field, password
field, hidden, check box, radio button, or push button. HTML5 extends the possibilities of
this form greatly and adds a number of features for browser-based validation without using
JavaScript.

generally a fragment identifier that references a location in the current document rather
than a remote resource.

Element-Specific Attributes
accept This attribute is used to list the MIME types accepted for file uploads when using a
file upload control (<input type="file">).
align With image form controls (type="image"), this attribute aligns the image with

respect to surrounding text. The HTML 4.01 transitional specification defines bottom, left,
middle, right, and top as allowable values. Netscape and Microsoft browsers might also
allow the use of attribute values such as absbottom or absmiddle. Like other presentationspecific aspects of HTML, the align attribute is dropped under the strict HTML 4.01
specification.

alt This attribute is used to display an alternative description of image buttons for text-

only browsers. The meaning of alt for forms of <input> beyond type="input" is not
defined.

autocomplete This Microsoft-specific attribute is used to indicate whether or not the form
field should be automatically filled in. The default value is no. HTML5 also supports this
attribute.
autofocus This HTML5 Boolean attribute is used to indicate that the user agent should
immediately focus this form item once its containing window object (usually the document)
is made active. It only takes an attribute value of autofocus when using the XML-style
syntax for HTML5. It is not defined for <input type="hidden">.
checked

The checked attribute should be used only for check box (type="checkbox")
and radio (type="radio") form controls. The presence of this attribute indicates that the
control should be displayed in its checked state.

disabled This attribute is used to turn off a form control. Elements will not be submitted,
nor will they receive any focus from the keyboard or mouse. Disabled form controls will not
be part of the tabbing order. The browser also might gray out the form that is disabled, to
indicate to the user that the form control is inactive. This attribute requires no value.
dynsrc In the Microsoft implementation, this attribute indicates the URL of a movie file and
is used instead of the src attribute for <input type="image">.
form This HTML5 attribute should be set to a string that corresponds to the id of the form
element that an interactive control such as a button is associated with. This allows form
elements in one form to trigger actions in others.
formaction This HTML5 attribute specifies a URL to target when the button is clicked,
similar to the use of the action attribute on a form element.

formenctype This attribute indicates how form data should be encoded before being sent to
the server. The default is application/x-www-form-urlencoded. This encoding replaces

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

formmethod This HTML5 attribute indicates how form information should be transferred
to the server using a particular HTTP method. A get value in the attribute indicates that
form data should be appended to the URL specified by the action attribute thus creating a
query string. This approach is quite simple but imposes a size limitation that is difficult to
gauge (may be as low as 2 kilobytes in real situations). A value of post for this attribute
transfers the data of the form in the message body using the HTTP POST method, which
imposes no data size limitation. Browsers may allow for other HTTP methods like delete
or put, as suggested by the HTML5 specification, but so far such usage is rare. The POST
method must be used when file attachments are used in a form.
formnovalidate This HTML5 Boolean attribute is used to indicate a form should not be

validated during submission. It is false by default but may be controlled either on the
button directly or on a containing or related form. Initially this was simply known as
novalidate.

formtarget This HTML5 attribute is set to the name of a window or frame that the button
will target the result of action; in other words, where the result should appear. This action is
similar to the target attribute on <a> and <form> tags. Initially, this attribute was simply
target in early drafts of HTML5.
height Defined under HTML5, though commonly supported in older browsers, this
attribute is used to size an input element particularly when images are used as in <input
type="image">. CSS properties are preferred.
hspace This Internet Explorer–specific attribute indicates the horizontal space, in pixels,
between the image and surrounding text when using <input type="image">.
list The HTML5 list attribute is used to set the id of a datalist element used to
provide a predefined list of options suggested to the user for entry.
loop In the Microsoft implementation, this attribute is used with <input type="image">
and the dynsrc attribute to cause a movie to loop. Its value is either a numeric loop count
or the keyword infinite. Later versions of Internet Explorer suggest using –1 to indicate
infinite.
lowsrc

This Microsoft-supported attribute contains the URL of an image to be initially
loaded when using <input type="image">. Typically, the lowsrc image is a lowresolution or black-and-white image that provides a quick preview of the image to follow.
Once the primary image is loaded, it replaces the lowsrc image.

max This HTML5 attribute should be set to a numeric value that is the high range allowed
in the form control. The min attribute sets the low range.

PART I

blank characters in the data with a plus character (+) and all other nonprinting characters
with a percent sign (%) followed by the character’s ASCII HEX representation. The
multipart/form-data option does not perform character conversion and transfers the
information as a compound MIME document. This must be used when using <inputtype="file">. It also might be possible to use another encoding, such as text/plain
with a mailed form, but in general you should be cautious about changing the enctype.

283

284

Part I:

Core Markup

maxlength This attribute indicates the maximum content length that can be entered in a
text form control (type="text"). The maximum number of characters allowed differs from
the visible dimension of the form control, which is set with the size attribute.
min This HTML5 attribute should be set to a numeric value that is the low range allowed
in the form control. The max attribute sets the high range.
multiple This HTML5 Boolean attribute, when set to true, indicates that multiple values
are allowed for the field.
name This attribute allows a form control to be assigned a name to set as the name/value
pair value sent to the server. Traditionally, this value was also used for reference by a
scripting language, but using the id value is more appropriate. However, given that
browsers sometimes favor the older syntax, both may often be used and set to the same
value, with some limitations, particularly with radio buttons.
pattern This HTML5 attribute specifies a regular expression against which the field should
be validated. The title attribute should be provided when this attribute is used, to give an
indication of what is an acceptable pattern and what isn’t.
placeholder This HTML5 attribute specifies a short bit of text that is used to help the user
figure out what type of information to fill in for a form control. Likely, the text will be
placed in the field and cleared upon focus.

readonly This attribute prevents the form control’s value from being changed. Form
controls with this attribute set might receive focus from the user but not permit the user to
modify the value. Because it receives focus, a readonly form control will be part of the
form’s tabbing order. The control’s value will be sent on form submission. This attribute can
be used only with <input> when type is set to text or password. The attribute also is
used with the textarea element.
required The presence of this HTML5 Boolean attribute indicates that the form field must

be set in order for form submission to proceed. User agents that understand this should set
the CSS pseudo-class :invalid when the field goes into error.

size This attribute indicates the visible dimension, in characters, of a text form control
(type="text"). This differs from the maximum length of content, which can be entered in a
form control set by the maxlength attribute.
src This attribute is used with image form controls (type="image") to specify the URL of
the image file to load.
step This HTML5 attribute defines the step in which values can take; for example, by twos
(2, 4, 6…) or tens (10, 20, 30…). It is generally used in range controls.
tabindex This attribute takes a numeric value that indicates the position of the form control
in the tabbing index for the form. Tabbing proceeds from the lowest positive tabindex
value to the highest. Negative values for tabindex will leave the form control out of the
tabbing order. When tabbing is not explicitly set, the browser tabs through items in the

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

285

order they are encountered. Disabled form fields will not be part of the tabbing index,
although read-only controls will be.
general-purpose button with no well-defined meaning. However, an action can be
associated with the button by using an event handler attribute, such as onclick. A value of
checkbox indicates a check box control. Check box form controls have a checked and
unchecked setting, but even if these controls are grouped together, they allow a user to
select multiple check boxes simultaneously. In contrast, a value of radio indicates a radio
button control. When grouped, radio buttons allow only one of the many choices to be
selected at a given time.
A form control type of hidden indicates a field that is not visible to the viewer but is
used to store information. A hidden form control often is used to preserve state information
between pages.
A value of file for the type attribute indicates a control that allows the viewer to
upload a file to a server. The filename can be entered in a displayed field, or a user agent
might provide a special browse button that allows the user to locate the file. A value of
image indicates a graphic image form control that a user can click on to invoke an
associated action. (Most browsers allow the use of img-associated attributes such as height,
width, hspace, vspace, and alt when the type value is set to image.) A value of
password for the type attribute indicates a password entry field. A password field will not
display text entered as it is typed; it might instead show a series of dots. Note that
password-entered data is not transferred to the server in any secure fashion. A value of
reset for the type attribute is used to insert a button that resets all controls within a form
to their default values. A value of submit inserts a special submission button that, when
clicked, sends the contents of the form to the location indicated by the action attribute of
the enclosing <form> tag. Lastly, a value of text (the default) for the type attribute
indicates a single-line text input field.
HTML5 expands greatly on this attribute’s possible values, specifying search, url,
email, tel, datetime, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and
color as well. Likely there will be others. Many of these ideas derived from the Web
Forms 2.0 specification, which Opera implements partially. WebKit also implements a select
number of these form field types. Likely other browsers will quickly follow suit.

usemap This HTML 4.0 attribute is used to indicate the map file to be associated with an

image when the form control is set with type="image". The value of the attribute should
be a URL of a map file but generally will be in the form of a URL fragment referencing a
map file within the current file.

value This attribute has two different uses, depending on the value for the type attribute.

With data-entry controls (type="text" and type="password"), this attribute is used to
set the default value for the control. When used with check box or radio button form
controls, this attribute specifies the return value for the control. If it is not set for these fields,
a default value of on will be submitted when the control is activated.

vspace This Internet Explorer–specific attribute indicates the vertical space, in pixels,
between the image and surrounding text when using <input type="image">.

type This attribute specifies the type of the form control. A value of button indicates a

width This attribute, initially supported by many browsers such as Internet Explorer for
image buttons and now defined under HTML5, is used to set the size of the form control, in
pixels. This should be controlled with CSS instead.

Notes

• The HTML 4.01 specification also reserves the use of the datafld, dataformatas,
and datasrc data-binding attributes. They were not included in the XHTML
specification but are supported by Internet Explorer.
• Use of autocomplete may have security implications. Use with caution.
• Under the strict HTML and XHTML specifications, the align attribute is not
allowed.
• As an empty element under XHTML or when using XML-style syntax for HTML5,
a trailing slash is required for this element: <input />.
• Safari running on the iPhone extends this element with autocorrect and
autocapitalize attributes. Given the difficulty of filling in forms on small-factor
devices, it is likely there may be other proprietary changes that are device specific.

<ins>

NOTE MSDN documentation for this element appears incorrect for event handlers. Not all core

events are listed, but during testing they all worked. Other extended events like onbeforecopy,
oncopy, oncontextmenu, and more were also verified as functional under Internet Explorer 8.

Element-Specific Attributes
cite The value of this attribute is a URL that designates a source document or message for
the information inserted. This attribute is intended to point to information explaining why
the text was changed.
datetime This attribute is used to indicate the date and time the insertion was made. The
value of the attribute is a date in a special format as defined by ISO 8601. The basic date
format is
yyyy-mm-ddthh:mm:ssTZD

where the following is true:
yyyy=four-digit year such as 2010
mm=two-digit month (01=January, 02=February, and so on)
dd=two-digit day of the month (01 through 31)

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

The time zone designator is either Z, which indicates Universal Time Coordinate or
coordinated universal time format (UTC), or +hh:mm, which indicates that the time is a local
time that is hh hours and mm minutes ahead of UTC. Alternatively, the format for the time
zone designator could be –hh:mm, which indicates that the local time is behind UTC. Note
that the letter T actually appears in the string, all digits must be used, and 00 values for
minutes and seconds might be required. An example value for the datetime attribute
might be 2009-10-6T09:15:00-05:00, which corresponds to October 6, 2010, 9:15 A.M.,
U.S. Eastern Standard Time.

Example
<p>We have the lowest prices in the galaxy! <ins cite="http://www
.democompany.com/changes/jan10.html"
date="2010-05-01T09:15:00-05:00">

Note
• Browsers can render inserted (<ins>) or deleted (<del>) text in a different style to
show the changes that have been made to the document. Typically, newly inserted
entries are underlined and deletions appear with strikethrough. In theory, a browser
could have a way to show a revision history on a document, but generally this is left
up to scripting or the environment the page is built in.

<isindex>

(Index Prompt)

This element indicates that a document has an associated searchable keyword index. When
a browser encounters this element, it inserts a query entry field at that point in the
document. The viewer can enter query terms to perform a search. This element is
deprecated under the strict HTML and XHTML specifications and should not be used.

action This attribute specifies the URL of the query action to be executed when the viewer
presses the ENTER key. Although this attribute is not defined under any HTML specification,
it is common to many browsers, particularly Internet Explorer 3, which defined it.
prompt This attribute allows a custom query prompt to be defined. The default prompt is
“This is a searchable index. Enter search keywords.”

Examples
<isindex action="cgi-bin/search.pl" prompt="Enter search terms">
<!-- very old HTML style syntax below -->
<base href="cgi-bin/search">
<isindex prompt="Enter search terms">

Notes
• Originally, the W3C intended this element to be used in a document’s header.
Browser vendors have relaxed this usage to allow the element in a document’s body.
Early implementations did not support the action attribute and used a <base> tag
or an href attribute to specify a search function’s URL.
• As an empty element, <isindex> requires no closing tag under HTML specifications.
However, under the XHTML specification, a trailing slash <isindex /> is required.
• The HTML 3.2 specification only allows the prompt attribute, whereas HTML 2
expected a text description to accompany the search field.

• Netscape 1.1 originated the use of the prompt attribute.
• This element is not found at all in newer specifications like HTML5.

Element-Specific Attributes
for This attribute specifies the id for the form control element the label references. This is
optional when the label encloses the form control it is bound to. In many cases, particularly
when a table is used to structure the form, a <label> tag will not be able to enclose the
associated form control, so the for attribute should be used. This attribute allows more than
one label to be associated with the same control by creating multiple references.

Examples
<form action="search.php" method="get">
<p>
<label id="searclabel">Search:
<input type="text" name="search" id="search">

<layer>

(Positioned Layer)

This Netscape 4.x–specific element allows the definition of overlapping content layers that can
be exactly positioned, hidden or shown, rendered transparent or opaque, reordered front to
back, and nested. The functionality of layers is available using CSS positioning facilities, and
the layer element is listed here purely for historical reasons in case developers come across
pages using them.

Syntax (Defined by Netscape 4 Only)
<layer
above="layer name"
background="URL of background image"
below="layer name"
bgcolor="color value"
class="class name(s)"
clip="clip region coordinates in x1, y1, x2, y2 form"
height="percentage | pixels"
id="unique alphanumeric identifier"
left="pixels"
name="string"
overflow="none | clip"
pagex="horizontal pixel position of layer"
pagey="vertical pixel position of layer"
src="URL of layer's contents"
style="style information"
title="advisory text"
top="pixels"
visibility="hide | inherit | show"
width="percentage | pixels"
z-index="number">
</layer>

Element-Specific Attributes
above This attribute contains the name of the layer (as set with the name attribute) to be
rendered directly above the current layer.

background This attribute contains the URL of a background pattern for the layer. Like
backgrounds for the document as a whole, the image might tile.

below This attribute specifies the name of the layer to be rendered below the current layer.
bgcolor This attribute specifies a layer’s background color. The attribute’s value can be

either a named color, such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format,
such as #FF0000.

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

297

clip This attribute clips a layer’s content to a specified rectangle. All layer content outside

height This attribute is used to set the height of the layer, either in pixels or as a percentage
of the screen or region the layer is contained within.
left This attribute specifies, in pixels, the left offset of the layer. The offset is relative to its
parent layer, if it has one, or to the left browser margin if it does not.
name This attribute assigns to the layer a name that can be referenced by programs in a
client-side scripting language. The id attribute also can be used.
overflow This attribute specifies what should happen when the layer’s content exceeds its
rendering box and clipping area. A value of none does not clip the content, while clip clips
the content to its dimensions or defined clipping area.
pagex This attribute is used to set the horizontal pixel position of the layer relative to the
document window rather than any enclosing layer.
pagey This attribute is used to set the vertical pixel position of the layer relative to the
document window rather than any enclosing layer.
src This attribute specifies the URL that contains the content to be included in the layer.
Using this attribute with an empty element is a good way to preserve layouts under older
browsers.
top This attribute specifies, in pixels, the top offset of the layer. The offset is relative to its

parent layer, if it has one, or to the top browser margin if it is not enclosed in another layer.

visibility This attribute specifies whether a layer is hidden (hidden), shown (show), or
inherits (inherits) its visibility from the layer enclosing it.

width This attribute specifies a layer’s width, in pixels or as a percentage value of the
enclosing layer or browser width.
z-index This attribute specifies a layer’s stacking order relative to other layers. Position is
specified with positive integers, with 1 indicating the bottommost layer.

Examples
<!-- 90s appropriate example to illustrate this element -->
<layer name="scene" bgcolor="#00FFFF">
<layer name="Shaq" left="100" top="100">
<img src="shaq.gif">
</layer>
<layer name="Rodman" left="200" top="100"
visibility="hidden">
<img src="pinkhair.gif">
</layer>
</layer>

PART I

that rectangle will be rendered transparent. The clip rectangle is defined by two x,y pairs
that correspond to the top x, left y, and bottom x, right y coordinate of the rectangle. The
coordinates are relative to the layer’s origin point, 0,0, in its top-left corner, and might have
nothing to do with the pixel coordinates of the screen.

Compatibility
No standards support

Netscape 4, 4.5–4.8

Notes
• The functionality of the layer element is easily replicated using a <div> tag and
the CSS property position:absolute. In older Netscape browsers, using this
more appropriate approach did populate the JavaScript document.layers
collection.
• Because this element is specific to Netscape 4, it should never be used and is
discussed only for readers supporting existing <layer>-filled pages they may come
across. The next edition of this book will remove this historical footnote.
• Applets, plug-ins, and other embedded media forms, generically called objects, can
be included in a layer; however, they will float to the top of all other layers, even if
their containing layer is obscured.

Element-Specific Attributes
accesskey

This attribute specifies a keyboard navigation accelerator for the element.
Pressing ALT or a similar key in association with the specified key selects the form section or
the legend itself. Page designers are forewarned to avoid key sequences already bound to
browsers.

align This attribute indicates where the legend value should be positioned within the

border created by a <fieldset> tag. The default position for the legend is the upper-left
corner. It also is possible to position the legend to the right by setting the attribute to right.

Notes
• Traditionally, a <legend> tag should occur only within a <fieldset> tag. There
should be only one legend per fieldset element.
• Under early drafts of the HTML5 specification, this element is also found in the
figure and details elements. This was later replaced by the dt element.
• Some versions of Microsoft documentation show a valign attribute for <legend>
positioning. However, the valign attribute does not appear to work consistently
and has since been dropped from the official documentation.

<li>

Part I:

Core Markup

Element-Specific Attributes
type This attribute indicates the bullet type used in unordered lists or the numbering type
used in ordered lists. For ordered lists, a value of a indicates lowercase letters, A indicates
uppercase letters, i indicates lowercase Roman numerals, I indicates uppercase Roman
numerals, and 1 indicates numbers. For unordered lists, values are used to specify bullet types.
Although the browser is free to set bullet styles, a value of disc generally specifies a filled
circle, a value of circle specifies an empty circle, and a value of square specifies a filled
square. This attribute should be avoided in favor of the CSS property list-style-type.
value This attribute indicates the current number of items in an ordered list as defined by
an <ol> tag. Regardless of the value of type being used to set Roman numerals or letters,
the only allowed value for this attribute is a number. List items that follow will continue
numbering from the value set. The value attribute has no meaning for unordered lists.
CSS 2 counters can provide much more flexibility than this attribute.

Examples
<ul>
<li type="circle">First list item is a circle</li>
<li type="square">Second list item is a square</li>
<li type="disc">Third list item is a disc</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li type="i">Roman Numerals</li>
<li type="a" value="3">Second list item is letter C</li>
<li type="a">Continue list in lowercase letters</li>
</ol>

Compatibility
HTML 2, 3.2, 4, 4.01, 5
XHTML 1.0, 1.1, Basic

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 2+,
Netscape 1+, Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• Under the strict HTML and XHTML definitions, the li element loses the type and
value attributes, as these presentation styles can be emulated with CSS properties
like list-item-style and CSS counters.
• HTML5 reintroduces the value attribute to list items but CSS should be used
instead.
• Whereas bullet styles can be set explicitly, browsers tend to change styles for bullets
when <ul> lists are nested. However, ordered lists generally do not change style
automatically, nor do they support outline-style numbering (1.1, 1.1.1, and so on).
CSS rules, of course, can do this.
• The closing tag </li> is optional under HTML specifications, including HTML5.
However, it is required under XHTML and should always be used.

Element-Specific Attributes
charset This attribute specifies the character set used by the linked document. Allowed

values for this attribute are character set names, such as EUC-JP, as defined in RFC 2045.

disabled This DOM Level 1–defined attribute is used to disable a link relationship.
The presence of the attribute is all that is required to remove a linking relationship. In
conjunction with scripting, this attribute could be used to turn on and off various style
sheet relationships.
href This attribute specifies the URL of the linked resource. A URL might be absolute or
relative.

hreflang This attribute is used to indicate the language of the linked resource. See the

“Language Attributes Reference” section earlier in this chapter for information on allowed
values.

media This attribute specifies the destination medium for any linked style information, as

indicated when the rel attribute is set to stylesheet. The value of the attribute might be a
single media descriptor, such as screen, or a comma-separated list. Possible values for this
attribute include all, aural, braille, print, projection, and screen. Other values also
might be defined, depending on the browser.

rel This attribute names a relationship between the linked document and the current
document. Multiple values can be specified and should be separated by spaces. The value
of the rel attribute is simply a text value, which can be anything the author desires.
However, a browser can interpret standardized relationships in a particular way. For
example, a browser might provide special icons or navigation features when the meaning
of a link is understood. Currently, document relationship values are neither widely
understood nor supported by browsers, but the HTML 4.01 and HTML5 specifications list
some proposed relationship values, as shown in Table 3-22. Note that these values are not
case sensitive.

308

Part I:

Core Markup

Under a few browsers, such as Opera, these link relationship values are recognized and
placed in a special navigation menu. For example, given the example here
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Link Relationship Examples</title>
<link rel="home" href="http://htmlref.com" title="Homepage">
<link rel="toc" href="http://htmlref.com/chapters/toc.html"

<link rel="author" href="http://htmlref.com/about/author.html"
title="About the author">
</head>
<body>
<p>Testing link element rel values</p>
</body>
</html>

when viewed in a supporting browser like Opera, you might have special buttons to
navigate a site:

Unfortunately, the reality is that over time fewer browsers have supported these link
element features.
The most commonly used rel values from Table 3-22 are described here in more depth.
Certainly, the most common use of this attribute is to specify a link to an external style
sheet. The rel attribute is set to stylesheet, and the href attribute is set to the URL of an
external style sheet to format the page:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="application/pdf" href="/css/global.css">

The alternate stylesheet relationship, which would allow users to pick from a
variety of styles, also is defined. To set several alternative styles, the title attribute must be
set to group elements belonging to the same style. All members of the same style must have
exactly the same value for title. For example, the following fragment defines a standard

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

309

style called basestyle.css, and two alternative styles, titled 640x480 and 1024x768, have been
added; these refer to style sheets to improve layout at various screen resolutions:

A Web browser should provide a method for users to view and pick from the list of
alternative styles, where the title attribute can be used to name each choice.
A rel value is also commonly used to specify the location of a blog feed. Using
markup like
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"
title="PINT Blog RSS Feed" href="http://blog.pint.com/feed/">

in the head of a document will cause supporting browsers to put a special subscription icon
in the location bar:

Given that there may be multiple feed formats, there may be a number of link alternate
entries:
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"
title="The Blog" href="/rss/index.xml">
<link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml"
title="Atom 0.3" href="/atom/index.xml">

So far this syntax is the common method, but things change rapidly in the “blogosphere,”
so checking with the documentation of blogging platforms is probably the best way to
ensure you have the very latest feed syntax for (X)HTML.
Another common use of this attribute is to set a browser location bar icon called a
favicon. These icons are set with the rel attribute using the value of icon or shortcut
icon:
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

Browsers commonly place these small images in the URL bar like so:

PART I

<link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="640x480" href="small.css"
type="text/css">
<link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="1024x768" href="big.css"
type="text/css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="basestyle.css" type="text/css">

310

Part I:

Core Markup

Browsers may also use favicons in a bookmark menu. Currently, the favicon image
should be a 16×16 image, though larger image sizes may be supported in other situations.
For example, Apple devices support a relationship of apple-touch-icon to set a larger
57×57 PNG format icon
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">

to be used on its mobile devices. This is just an example to illustrate that many browser- or
environment-specific uses of <link> relationships likely exist.
Finally, in some browsers if the rel attribute is set with the value of next (or, in other
cases, prefetch) along with an href value of some data object, the browser will “prefetch”
the item in question during the idle time of the browser. If the content of the next page is
stored in the browser’s cache, the page loads much faster than if the page has to be
requested from the server.
Mozilla-based browsers support this syntax already with a relation type of either next
or prefetch. For example, you might use <link> like this:
<link rel="prefetch" href="/images/product.jpeg">

This would be the same as providing a prefetching hint using an HTTP Link: header:
Link: </images/product.jpeg>; rel=prefetch

It is possible to prefetch a variety of objects in a page during a browser’s idle time.
Consider the following example:
<link rel="prefetch" href="bigflash.swf">
<link rel="prefetch" href="ajaxlibrary.js">
<link rel="next" href="2.html">

While prefetching is only built into some browsers, it is possible using JavaScript to
preload objects as well. Regardless of the prefetch method, be careful not to disrupt the load
or use of a currently viewed page with preloading, and be mindful that you may be wasting
bandwidth on requests that are never used.

rev The value of the rev attribute shows the relationship of the current document to the
linked document, as defined by the href attribute. The attribute thus defines the reverse
relationship compared to the value of the rel attribute. Multiple values can be specified
and should be separated by spaces. Values for the rev attribute are similar to the possible
values for rel. They might include alternate, bookmark, chapter, contents,
copyright, glossary, help, index, next, prev, section, start, stylesheet, and
subsection. HTML5 does not define this attribute—likely with good cause, because its
usage is quite rare and its value nebulous.
sizes This HTML5 attribute is used when the rel attribute has a value of icon to define
the size of the related icon in a Height×Width format. The attribute takes a space-separated
list if multiple forms are possible or takes the keyword any if size doesn’t matter. See the
examples that follow for a demonstration.

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

311

target The value of the target attribute defines the frame or window name that has the
defined linking relationship or that will show the rendering of any linked resource.

Examples
<link href="products.html" rel="parent">
<link href="corpstyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">
<!-- XHTML syntax -->
<link href="corpstyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" />

Notes
• As an empty element under XHTML, or when using XML-style syntax for HTML5,
a trailing slash is required for this element: <link />.
• A <link> tag can occur only in the head element; however, there can be multiple
occurrences of <link>.
• HTML 3.2 defines only the href, rel, rev, and title attributes for the link
element.
• HTML 2 defines the href, methods, rel, rev, title, and urn attributes for the
link element. The methods and urn attributes were later removed from the
specifications.

<listing>

(Code Listing)

This deprecated element from HTML 2 is used to indicate a code listing; it is no longer part
of the HTML standard. Text tends to be rendered in a smaller size within this element. A
<pre> tag should be used instead of this element.

type This attribute is used to define the type of the content linked to. The value of the
attribute should be a MIME type, such as text/html, text/css, and so on. The common
use of this attribute is to define the type of style sheet linked, and the most common current
value is text/css, which indicates a CSS format.

Notes
• As a deprecated element, this element should not be used. This element is not

many browser vendors. The pre element should be used instead of <listing>.
• Many browsers also make text within <listing> tags one size smaller than normal
text, probably because the HTML 2 specification suggested that 132 characters fit on
a typical line rather than 80.

<map>

This element is used to implement client-side image maps. The element is used to define
a map that associates locations on an image with a destination URL. Each hot spot or
hyperlink mapping is defined by an enclosed area element. A map is bound to a particular

Element-Specific Attribute
name Like id, this attribute is used to define a name associated with the element. In the
case of the map element, the name attribute is the common way to define the name of the
image map to be referenced by the usemap attribute within an <img> tag.

Example
<map name="mainmap" id="mainmap">
<area shape="circle" coords="200,250,25"
href="file1.html" />
<area shape="rectangle" coords="50,50,100,100"
href="file2.html#important" />

Notes
• HTML 3.2 supports only the name attribute for the map element.
• When the name attribute is used, it should be the same as the id attribute.
• Client-side image maps are not supported under HTML 2. They were first
suggested by Spyglass and later incorporated into Netscape and other browsers.
• Given the usability concerns with image maps, alternate access forms such as
related text links should be provided.

<mark>

(Marked Text)

This HTML5 element defines a marked section of text. It should be used in a sense similar
to how a highlighter is used on text.

bgcolor This attribute specifies the marquee’s background color. The value for the attribute
can either be a color name or a color value defined in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.

direction This attribute specifies the direction in which the marquee should scroll. The
default is left. Other possible values for direction include down, right, and up.
loop This attribute indicates the number of times the marquee content should loop. By

default, a marquee loops infinitely unless the behavior attribute is set to slide. It also is
possible to use a value of infinite or −1 to set the text to loop indefinitely.

scrollamount This attribute specifies the width, in pixels, between successive displays of
the scrolling text in the marquee.

scrolldelay This attribute specifies the delay, in milliseconds, between successive displays
of the text in the marquee.
truespeed When this attribute is present, it indicates that the scrolldelay value should
be honored for its exact value. If the attribute is not present, any value less than 60 is
rounded up to 60 milliseconds.

Notes
• This is primarily a Microsoft-specific element, although most browsers support it to

supported consistently or even at all beyond Internet Explorer.
• There is a placeholder in the current HTML5 specification that discusses this
element will be found in browsers, so its future is still unclear.

then cross in the opposite direction. A value of scroll for the attribute causes text to wrap
around and start over again. This is the default value for a marquee. A value of slide for
this attribute causes text to cross the marquee field and stop when its leading character
reaches the opposite side.

compact This attribute indicates that the list should be rendered in a compact style. Few
browsers actually change the rendering of the list, regardless of the presence of this
attribute. The compact attribute requires no value under traditional HTML but should be

label This HTML5 attribute defines a string label for the menu. This will be particularly
useful in the case of a nested menu.

type This HTML5 attribute indicates whether the menu should be a standard menu that
a user can interact with (toolbar) or a contextual menu, usually activated by a right-click
(contextmenu).

Notes
• Under the strict HTML and XHTML specifications, this element is not defined.
Because most browsers simply render this style of list as an unordered list, using the
<ul> tag instead is preferable.
• HTML5 keeps the traditional sense of this element, but it also introduces a new
sense as an actual menu of commands. In this new use, the content model is much
different and the element may include list items, anchors, form fields, command
elements, and horizontal rules. At the time of this writing, no browsers support this
extended functionality.
• HTML5 may also allow menu elements to be referenced by id using the global
contextmenu attribute.
• The HTML 2.0 and 3.2 specifications support only the compact attribute, though
most browsers don’t do anything with this attribute anyway.

<meta>

This element specifies general information about a document that can be used in document
indexing. It also allows a document to define fields in the HTTP response header when it is
sent from the server.

charset This HTML5 attribute is used to set the character encoding for the document like

“UTF-8”. This approach is an alternative to using the http-equiv method currently
employed.

content This attribute contains the actual meta-information. The form of the meta-information
varies greatly, depending on the value set for name.
http-equiv This attribute binds the meta-information in the content attribute to an
equivalent HTTP response header. If this attribute is present, the name attribute should not
be used.
name

This attribute associates a name with the meta-information contained in the

content attribute. If the name attribute is present, the http-equiv attribute should not

be used.

scheme The scheme attribute is used to indicate the expected format of the value of the

content attribute. The particular scheme also can be used in conjunction with the metadata
profile, as indicated by the profile attribute for the head element. This attribute is not
currently defined for inclusion in HTML5.

Notes
• The meta element can occur only in the head element. It can be defined multiple
times.
• As an empty element under XHTML, or when using XML-style syntax for HTML5,
a trailing slash is required for this element: <meta />.
• A common use of the meta element is to set information for indexing tools, such as
search engines. Common values for the name attribute when performing this
function include author, description, and keywords; other attributes also might
be possible.
• The http-equiv attribute is often used to create a document that automatically
loads another document after a set time. This is called client-pull. An example of a
client-pull meta element is <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10;URL='
nextpage.html'">. Note that the content attribute contains two values: the first
is the number of seconds to wait, and the second is the identifier URL and the URL
to load after the specified time.

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

• The <meta> tag can be used arbitrarily by site owners, search services, and browser
vendors. For example, when defining pages for Apple’s iPhone, the viewport and
format-detection values for a <meta> tag can be set to control presentation on
the device. Google uses a verify-v1 value for approving sites for some
Webmaster-related features. Many more examples can be found online; the point is
that the element is quite flexible and has numerous uses.
• The HTML 2.0 and 3.2 specifications define only the content, http-equiv, and
name attributes.
• The meanings of some HTML5 common attributes (particularly those that are
interface-oriented, such as accesskey, dragable, and spellcheck) are quite
unclear. The specification currently puts these attributes everywhere, unlike HTML 4,
which does remove core attributes when context is inappropriate. Do not be
surprised if they are removed from some HTML5 elements in future revisions to the
specification.
• The HTML5 specification states that the http-equiv attribute should not set
Content-Language values; the lang attribute should be used in the document
instead.

<meter>

This HTML5 element defines a scalar measurement within a known range, similar to what
might be represented by a gauge.

PART I

• The http-equiv attribute is also used for page ratings, cache control, setting
defaults such as language or scripting, and a variety of other tasks. In many cases, it
would be better to set these values via the actual HTTP headers rather than via a
<meta> tag.

Notes

• This element is not yet implemented in any browser. However, given that most
browsers can handle custom elements, it would be easy enough to simulate the idea
of it and even apply a CSS display property for it. Using scripting, you might
animate or present some visual representation of the data.

<multicol>

(Multiple Column Text)

This Netscape-specific element renders the enclosed content in multiple columns. This
element should not be used; a table is a more standard way to render multiple columns of
text across browsers. CSS properties like column-width and column-count perform the
same function when supported.

Proprietary Syntax (Defined by Netscape)
<multicol
class="class name(s)"
cols="number of columns"
gutter="pixels"
id="unique alphanumeric identifier"
style="style information"
width="pixels">
</multicol>

Element-Specific Attributes
cols This attribute indicates the number of columns in which to display the text. The
browser attempts to fill the columns evenly.

gutter This attribute indicates the width, in pixels, between the columns. The default value
for this attribute is ten pixels.
width This attribute indicates the column width for all columns. The width of each column
is set in pixels and is equivalent for all columns in the group. If the attribute is not specified,
the width of columns will be determined by taking the available window size, subtracting
the number of pixels for the gutter between the columns (as specified by the gutter
attribute), and evenly dividing the result by the number of columns in the group (as set by
the cols attribute).

Example
<multicol cols="3" gutter="20">
Put a long piece of text here....
</multicol>

PART I

• The assumption is that values are used in the correct sense; for example, a min value
cannot be greater than a max value, a low value can’t be greater than a high value,
an optimum value cannot be greater than a high value, and so on.

or secondary site navigation or possibly page-related links.
• While this element is not yet supported, it is easily simulated by using a custom tag
or using a <div> tag with a special class.

Examples
<nobr>This really long text ... will not be broken.</nobr>
<nobr>With this element it is often important to hint where a line may
be broken using &lt;wbr&gt;.<wbr> This element acts as a soft return.</

Compatibility
No standards support

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 4+, Netscape 1.1+, Opera 4+

Notes
• While many browsers support this attribute, it is not part of any W3C standard.
• See the “<wbr> (Word Break)” section later in the chapter for a discussion of how to
implement soft-break functionality without the proprietary wbr element.

<noembed>

(No Embedded Media Support)

This Netscape-introduced element is used to indicate alternative content to be displayed on
browsers that cannot support an embedded media object. It should occur in conjunction
with the embed element.

Proprietary Syntax (Initially Defined by Netscape)
<noembed
class="class name"
id="unique id"
style="CSS rules"
title="advisory text">
Alternative content for browsers that do not support embed
</noembed>

Element-Specific Attributes

Netscape does not specifically define attributes for this element; however, testing and
documentation suggests that class, id, style, and title might be supported for this
element in many browsers.

Example
<embed src="trailer.mov" height="300" width="300">
<noembed>
<img src="error.gif" alt="Error">
<p>This browser is not configured to display video</p>
</noembed>

<noframes>

(No Frame Support Content)

This element is used to indicate alternative content to be displayed on browsers that do not
support frames.

Standard Syntax
<noframes
class="class name(s)"
dir="ltr | rtl"
id="unique alphanumeric identifier"
lang="language code"
style="style information"

Compatibility
HTML 4, 4.01 (transitional and frameset)
XHTML 1.0 (transitional and frameset)

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 2+,
Netscape 2+, Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• This element should be used within the scope of the frameset element.
• This element has no inclusion under HTML5 because standard frames are not
included in that specification.

PART I

• Even if other browsers do not support the tag and render the contents of a
<noembed> tag, it works in the manner it was designed, given how browsers handle
unknown elements.

330

Part I:

Core Markup

• The benefit of events and sophisticated attributes, such as style, is unclear for
browsers that would use content within <noframes>, given that older browsers
that don’t support frames probably would not support these features.

<noscript>

(No Script Support Content)

This element is used to enclose content that should be rendered on browsers that do not
support scripting or that have scripting turned off.

Syntax

Note
• Besides using the noscript element, it may be wise to employ a comment mask
around any script code that is embedded rather than linked. Oddly, under HTML 4
<noscript> is not allowed in the head even though <script> is. Under HTML5 it
is allowed, though with a limited set of content within it and is not defined when
XML syntax is used.

<object>

(Embedded Object)

This element specifies an arbitrary object to be included in an HTML document. Initially,
this element was used to insert ActiveX controls, but according to the specification, an object
can be any media object, document, applet, interactive control, or even image.

Element-Specific Attributes
align This attribute aligns the object with respect to the surrounding text. The default is

left. The HTML specification defines bottom, middle, right, and top, as well. Browsers
might provide an even richer set of alignment values. The behavior of alignment for objects
is similar to images. Under the strict HTML and XHTML specifications, the object element
does not support this attribute.

archive

This attribute contains a URL for the location of an archive file. An archive file
typically is used to contain multiple object files to improve the efficiency of access.

border This attribute specifies the width of the object’s borders, in pixels or as a percentage.
classid This attribute contains a URL for an object’s implementation. The URL syntax

depends upon the object’s type. With ActiveX controls, the value of this attribute does not
appear to be a URL but something of the form CLSID: object-id; for example, CLSID:
99B42120-6EC7-11CF-A6C7-00AA00A47DD2.

code Under the old Microsoft implementation, this attribute contains the URL referencing

a Java applet class file. The way to access a Java applet under the HTML/XHTML
specification is to use <object classid="java: classname.class">. The pseudo-URL
java: is used to indicate a Java applet. Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 and beyond support
this style, so code should not be used.

codebase This attribute contains a URL to use as a relative base to access the object
specified by the classid attribute.

codetype This attribute specifies an object’s MIME type. Do not confuse this attribute with

type, which specifies the MIME type of the data the object may use, as defined by the data
attribute.

data This attribute contains a URL for data required by an object.
declare This attribute declares an object without instantiating it. This is useful when the
object will be a parameter to another object. In traditional HTML, this attribute takes no
value; under XHTML, set it equal to declare.

name Under the older forms of HTML, this attribute defines the name of the control so
that scripting can access it. The id attribute should be used if possible.
standby This attribute contains a text message to be displayed while the object is loading.
type This attribute specifies the MIME type for the object’s data. This is different from
codetype, which is the MIME type of the object and not of the data it uses.

usemap This attribute contains the URL of the image map to be used with the object.

Typically, the URL will be a fragment identifier referencing a map element somewhere else
within the file. The presence of this attribute indicates that the type of object being included
is an image.

vspace This attribute indicates the vertical space, in pixels or as a percentage, between the
object and surrounding text.

Examples
<!-- Using XHTML syntax with trailing slashes here -->
<object id="IeLabel1" width="325" height="65"
classid="CLSID:99B42120-6EC7-11CF-A6C7-00AA00A47DD2">

Compatibility
Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 3+,
Netscape 4+, Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• Under the strict HTML and XHTML specifications, the object element loses most
of its presentation attributes, including align, border, height, hspace, vspace,
and width. These attributes are replaced by style sheet rules.
• The HTML 4.01 specification reserves the datafld, dataformatas, and datasrc
attributes for future use. However, these attributes were dropped in XHTML,
though they are well supported by Internet Explorer 4 and beyond.
• Alternative content should be defined within an <object> tag after any enclosed
<param> tags.
• The object element is still mainly used to include multimedia binaries in pages.
Although the specification defines that it can load in HTML files, insert a variety of
other objects, and create image maps, not every browser supports this, and few
developers are aware of these features. In theory, this very versatile tag should take
over duties from the venerable <img> tag in future specifications, though given the
media-specific element trends of HTML5, this seems unlikely to happen.

<ol>

(Ordered List)

This element is used to define an ordered or numbered list of items. The numbering style
comes in many forms, including letters, Roman numerals, and regular numerals. The
individual items within the list are specified by li elements included with the ol element.

Standard Syntax
<ol
class="class name(s)"
compact="compact" (transitional only)
dir="ltr | rtl"
id="unique alphanumeric identifier"
lang="language code"
start="number" (transitional versions and HTML5)

Element-Specific Attributes
compact This attribute indicates that the list should be rendered in a compact style. Few
browsers actually change the rendering of the list, regardless of the presence of this
attribute. The compact attribute requires no value under traditional HTML but under
XHTML should be set to compact.

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

start This attribute specifies the start value for numbering the individual list items.
Although the ordering type of list elements might be Roman numerals, such as XXXI, or
letters, the value of start is always represented as a number. To start numbering elements
from the letter C, use <ol type="A" start="3">.
type This attribute indicates the numbering type: a indicates lowercase letters, A indicates

uppercase letters, i indicates lowercase Roman numerals, I indicates uppercase Roman
numerals, and 1 indicates numbers. Type set in an ol element is used for the entire list
unless a type attribute is used within an enclosed li element.

Examples
<ol type="1">
<li>First step
<ol>
<li>Watch nested lists</li>
<li>Often closed wrong</li>

Notes
• Under the strict HTML and XHTML specifications, the ol element no longer
supports the compact, start, and type attributes. These aspects of lists can be
controlled with style sheet rules.

PART I

reversed This HTML5 Boolean attribute specifies that the counting of the list should go in
reverse order. CSS counters provide much more functionality than this attribute, but it is
useful in the absence of this more complicated syntax.

337

338

Part I:

Core Markup

• HTML5 returns the start attribute to ordered lists and adds the reversed
attribute.
• Under the XHTML 1.0 specification, the compact attribute must have a quoted
attribute value: <ol compact="compact">.
• The HTML 3.2 specification supports only the compact, start, and type attributes.
• The HTML 2.0 specification supports only the compact attribute.

<optgroup>

(Option Grouping)

element is associated with; otherwise, the nearest parent form is used.
name This attribute should set the name to be used in a name/value pair if the element is
used in form submission.

Examples
<form action="#" method="get" id="testform">
<p><input type="date" id="year"
oninput="year.value = valueAsDate.getYear()">

Element-Specific Attribute
align This attribute specifies the alignment of text within a paragraph. The default value is
left. The transitional specification of HTML 4.01 also defines center, justify, and
right. However, under the strict HTML and XHTML specifications, text alignment can be
handled through the CSS property text-align.

Examples
<p align="right">A right-aligned paragraph</p>
<p id="para1" class="defaultParagraph"
title="Introduction Paragraph">
This is the introductory paragraph for a very long paper about nothing.

Notes
• Because p is a block element, browsers typically insert a blank line, but this
rendering should not be assumed, given the rise of style sheets, which can use the
display property to override this action.
• Under the strict (X)HTML and HTML5 specifications, the align attribute is not
supported. Alignment of text can instead be accomplished using CSS properties like
text-align.

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

• As a logical element, empty paragraphs are ignored by browsers, so do not try to
use multiple <p> tags in a row, like <p><p><p><p>, to add blank lines to a Web
page.
• Often, nonbreaking space entities are used to hold open empty paragraphs, like so:
<p>&nbsp;</p>. The value of this markup is questionable.
• The HTML 3.2 specification supports only the align attribute with values of
center, left, and right.
• The HTML 2.0 specification supports no attributes for the p element.

<param>

Element-Specific Attributes
name This attribute contains the parameter’s name. The name of the parameter depends
on the particular object being inserted into the page, and it is assumed that the object knows
how to handle the passed data. Do not confuse the name attribute for this element with the
name attribute used for form elements. In the latter case, the name attribute does not have a
similar meaning to id, but rather specifies the name of the data to be passed to an enclosing
<object> tag.
type When the valuetype attribute is set to ref, the type attribute can be used to indicate
the type of information to be retrieved. Legal values for this attribute are in the form of
MIME types, such as text/html.

value This attribute contains the parameter’s value. The actual content of this attribute
depends on the object and the particular parameter being passed in, as determined by the
name attribute.
valuetype This attribute specifies the type of the value attribute being passed in. Possible
values for this attribute include data, object, and ref. A value of data specifies that the
information passed in through the value parameter should be treated just as data. A value
of ref indicates that the information being passed in is a URL that indicates where the data
to be used is located. The information is not retrieved, but the URL is passed to the object,
which then can retrieve the information if necessary. The last value, object, indicates that
the value being passed in is the name of an object as set by its id attribute. In practice, the
data attribute is used by default.

<applet code="plot.class">
<param name="min" value="5">

<plaintext>

(Plain Text)

This deprecated element from the HTML 2.0 specification renders the enclosed text as plain
text and forces the browser to ignore any enclosed HTML. Typically, information affected by
the <plaintext> tag is rendered in monospaced font. This element is no longer part of the
HTML standard and should never be used.

Notes
• No closing tag for this element is necessary because the browser will ignore all tags
after the starting tag.
• This element should not be used. Plain text information can be indicated by a file
type, and information can be inserted in a preformatted fashion using the pre
element.
• All modern browsers at the time of this edition continue to support this tag despite
documentation to the contrary.

<pre>

(Preformatted Text)

This element is used to indicate that the enclosed text is preformatted, meaning that spaces,
returns, tabs, and other formatting characters are preserved. Browsers will, however,
acknowledge most HTML elements that are found within a <pre> tag. Preformatted text
generally will be rendered by the browsers in a monospaced font.

Element-Specific Attributes
width This attribute should be set to the width of the preformatted region. The value of the
attribute should be the number of characters to display. In practice, this attribute is not
supported and is dropped under the strict HTML 4.01 specification.
wrap

In some versions of Microsoft browsers, this attribute controls word wrap behavior
within a <pre> tag. The default value of off for the attribute forces the element not to wrap
text, so the viewer must manually enter line breaks. A value of hard or soft causes word
wrap and sets different types of line breaks in the wrapped text. Given the nature of the pre
element, the value of this attribute is limited.

xml:space This attribute is included from XHTML 1.0 and is used to set whether spaces need
to be preserved within the element or the default whitespace handling should be employed.

Notes
• The HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 transitional specifications state that the applet,
basefont, big, font, img, object, small, sub, and sup elements should not be used
within a <pre> tag. The strict HTML and XHTML specifications state that only the
<big>, <img>, <object>, <small>, <sub>, and <sup> tags should not be used within
the <pre> tag. The other excluded elements are missing, as they are deprecated from
the strict specification. Although these elements should not be used, it appears that the
more popular browsers will render them anyway.
• The strict HTML and XHTML specifications drop support for the width attribute,
which was not well supported anyway.
• The HTML 2.0 and 3.2 specifications support only the width attribute for the pre
element.

<progress>

(Progress Indicator)

This HTML5 element defines completion progress for a task. It is often thought to represent
the percentage from 0 to 100% of some task, such as loading to be completed, though the
range and the unit value are arbitrary.

max The value of this attribute is a positive floating-point number indicating the
maximum value for progress; often it will be 100.

value The value of this attribute is the amount of task complete. This may be a percentage,
but there is no requirement that it be such a measurement.

Example
<p>Progress: <progress id="prog1" max="100.00" value="33.1">33.1</
progress>%</p>
<!-- JavaScript would be used to change the value of this element

Compatibility
HTML5

Not currently supported by any browsers, but could be simulated in modern browsers
via a custom element and JavaScript.

Notes
• There are no units implied for this element.
• This element is not yet implemented in any browser. However, given that most
browsers can handle custom elements, it would be easy enough to simulate the idea
of it and even apply a CSS display property for it. But, without JavaScript changing
value and presentation dynamically, a custom element would have little value.

Notes
• This element is intended for short quotations that don’t require paragraphs or larger
structures, as compared to text that would be contained within <blockquote>.
• Some browsers, like Internet Explorer 6, may not make any sort of style change for
quotations, but it is possible to apply a style rule to provide some indication of a
change in style.
• Most browsers, including IE 8+, Opera, Safari, and Mozilla-based browsers like
Firefox, will wrap inline quotations in quote marks. These can be controlled by style
rules. Mentions in the HTML5 specification suggest that user agents will not put in
quotation marks and this will be left solely to the developer. This seems a highly
dubious possibility.

<rp>

This element is used to define parentheses around a ruby text entry defined by an rt

(Ruby Text)

This initially Microsoft-specific proprietary element, now part of HTML5 and XHTML 1.1,
is used within a <ruby> tag to create ruby text, or annotations or pronunciation guides for
words and phrases. The base text should be enclosed in a <ruby> tag; the annotation,
enclosed in an <rt> tag, will appear as smaller text above the base text. Ruby parentheses
should be set with <rp> tags to provide fallback for browsers without ruby support.

• Other browsers do not position the ruby text element (rt) but instead move the rt
content above the text it is associated with; thus, these browsers are not listed as
supporting rt. The purpose of the rp element is to show the grouping parentheses
in such nonsupporting browsers, so in some sense all browsers support this

(Ruby Annotation)

This initially Microsoft-specific element, now part of HTML5, is used with the rt element to
create annotations or pronunciation guides for words and phrases. The base text should be
enclosed in a <ruby> tag; the annotation, enclosed in an <rt> tag, will appear as smaller
text above the base text. The rp element can be used to wrap content to delimit ruby text
for browsers that do not support this formatting.

Events Defined by HTML5

Events Defined by Internet Explorer
onload, onpropertychange, onreadystatechange

Element-Specific Attributes
async Presence of this HTML5 attribute indicates that the browser might perform the fetch

or execution of the script to be asynchronously from other activity in the page. The meaning
of this attribute versus the defer attribute with remote scripts in particular is quite unclear.

charset This attribute defines the character encoding of the script. The value is a space- and/
or comma-delimited list of character sets as defined in RFC 2045.
defer Presence of this attribute indicates that the browser might defer execution of the
script enclosed by the <script> tag. Support for this attribute is inconsistent, though it is
now part of the HTML5 specification.
event This Microsoft-specific attribute is used to define a particular event that the script

should react to. It must be used in conjunction with the for attribute. Event names are the
same as event handler attributes; for example, onclick, ondblclick, and so on.

for The for attribute is used in Microsoft browsers to define the name or id of the element
to which an event defined by the event attribute is related. For example, <script
event="onclick" for="button1" language="vbscript"> defines a VBScript that will
execute when a click event is issued for an element named button1.
language This common though nonstandard attribute specifies the scripting language being
used. The Netscape implementation supports JavaScript. The Microsoft implementation
supports JScript (a JavaScript clone) as well as VBScript, which can be indicated by either
vbs or vbscript. Other values that include the version of the language used, such as
JavaScript1.1 and JavaScript1.2, also might be possible and are useful to exclude
browsers from executing script code that is not supported. The HTML5 specification
indicates that while this attribute may be widely supported it should not be used by page
authors.
src

This attribute specifies the URL of a file containing scripting code. Typically, files
containing JavaScript code will have a .js extension, and a server will attach the appropriate
MIME type; if not, the type attribute might be used to explicitly set the content type of the
external script file. The language attribute also might be helpful in determining this.

type This attribute should be set to the MIME type corresponding to the scripting language
used. For JavaScript, for example, this would be text/javascript. In practice, the
language attribute is more commonly used, but the type attribute is standard. When not
specified, the default value is text/javascript. There is indication that it should actually
be application/javascript, but given that browser support for this value is not
consistent it is dangerous to use. Also, it is possible to indicate version information in the
type attribute for certain browsers; for example, to indicate JavaScript 1.8 you would use
<script type="application/javascript;version=1.8">.
xml:space This attribute is included from XHTML 1.0 and is used to set whether spaces

need to be preserved within the script element or the default whitespace handling should
be employed. In practice, this attribute is not often used by developers.

Examples
<script type="text/javascript">
alert("Hello World !!!");
</script>
<!-- code in external file -->
<script language="JavaScript1.2" src="superlib.js"></script>

Compatibility
HTML 4, 4.01, 5
XHTML 1.0, 1.1

Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 3+,
Netscape 2+, Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• It is common practice to comment out statements enclosed by a <script> tag.
Without commenting, script code can be displayed as page content by user agents
that do not support scripting. The particular comment style might be dependent on
the language being used. For example, in JavaScript, use
<script type="text/javascript">
<!-JavaScript code here
// -->
</script>

In VBScript, use
<script type="text/vbscript">
<!-VBScript code here
-->
</script>

XML escapes using CDATA sections are also possible; however, in all cases it is better
to avoid intermixing script code in a markup document and instead to link to it.
• The HTML 3.2 specification defined a placeholder script element.
• The event and for attributes are defined under transitional versions of HTML 4.01
but only as reserved values. Later specifications appear to have dropped potential
support for them, though they continue to be supported by Internet Explorer.

Chapter 3:

• Most browsers assume JavaScript when parsing a script element without a set type
or language attribute.

• HTML5 currently specifies all common attributes for a <script> tag, such as
accesskey, spellcheck, and so on, but most of these make little if no sense in the
context of this element.

• The section element is included in HTML5’s document outlining process.
• This element is not yet implemented in any browser. However, given that most
browsers can handle custom elements, it would be easy enough to simulate the idea
of it and even apply a CSS display property for it.

Element-Specific Attributes
align This Microsoft-specific attribute controls the alignment of the image with respect to
the content on the page. The default value is left, but other values such as absbottom,
absmiddle, baseline, bottom, middle, right, texttop, and top also might be

supported. The meaning of these values should be similar to those used for inserted objects,
such as images.

autofocus This HTML5 Boolean attribute is used to indicate that the user agent should
immediately focus this form item once its containing window object (usually the document)
is made active. It only takes an attribute value of autofocus when using the XML-style
syntax for HTML5.
disabled This attribute is used to turn off a form control. Elements will not be submitted,
nor can they receive any focus from the keyboard or mouse. Disabled form controls will not
be part of the tabbing order. The browser also can gray out the form that is disabled, to
indicate to the user that the form control is inactive. This attribute requires no value under
traditional HTML, but under XHTML variants it should be set to disabled.
form This HTML5 attribute should be set to a string that corresponds to the id of the form
element that the button is associated with. This allows form elements in one form to trigger
actions in others.
multiple This attribute allows the selection of multiple items in the selection list. The
default is single-item selection. Under XHTML, this attribute must have its value set to
multiple.
name This attribute allows a form control to be assigned a name for defining the name/
value pair used in form submission. Traditionally, these values were used by scripting
languages as well, though the standards encourage the use of the id attribute. For
compatibility purposes, both might have to be used.
size This attribute sets the number of visible items in the selection list. When the multiple
attribute is not present, only one entry should show; however, when multiple is present,
this attribute is useful for setting the size of the scrolling list box.

tabindex

This attribute takes a numeric value indicating the position of the form control
in the tabbing index for the form. Tabbing proceeds from the lowest positive tabindex
value to the highest. Negative values for tabindex will leave the form control out of the

Notes
• The HTML 4.01 specification reserves the attributes datafld and datasrc for
future use, but these are removed under XHTML.
• Internet Explorer’s variant of the disabled attribute allows values of true and
false, as well as the standard disabled value.
• Under traditional HTML, the end tag </option> is often omitted.
• Be careful of the name and id attribute problem that may occur, particularly when
setting the multiple attribute. It may be better to have separate values.
• The HTML 2.0 and 3.2 specifications define only multiple, name, and size
attributes.

Notes
• This element is equivalent to using font-size: smaller.
• A <small> tag can be used multiple times to decrease the size of text to a greater
degree. Using more than six <small> tags together doesn’t make sense because
browsers currently only support relative font sizes from 1 to 7 or, in CSS, from
xx-small to xx-large.
• With style sheets, it would seem this element should be inappropriate, similar to
other obsolete or deprecated elements, including big, which is marked obsolete
under HTML5. However, currently it is included in the specification and is defined
to indicate side comments or small print text, as in legal information.

<source>

This empty HTML5 element is used to specify multiple media resources for media elements
like audio and video.

Element-Specific Attributes
media This attribute defines the intended media type of the linked media source, to

provide a hint to a user agent as to whether the media referenced is appropriate or how it
might be used. It is similar to the idea of a media attribute in a style sheet specifying print,
screen, projection, or other common values.

src

This attribute is set to the URL of the media source to link to.

type This attribute is set to the MIME type of the linked media file specified by the src
attribute. Often it also includes a codecs value to indicate how a media resource is
encoded. However, the use of codecs, as alluded to in Chapter 2, is a bit of a mess under
HTML5 so page authors are urged to test carefully.

Examples
<!-- Multiple sources to try -->
<audio>
<source src="angus.ogg">
<source src="angus.mp4" type="audio/mp4">
</audio>
<!-- XHTML style -->
<video>
<source src="angus.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs='avc1.58A01E, mp4a.40.2'" />
</video>

Notes

• Browsers should use multiple source elements in a fall-through fashion finding the
first appropriate version for playback. Page authors should consider putting in an
appropriate number of media variations to account for browser differences.

<spacer>

(Extra Space)

This older, Netscape-proprietary element specifies an invisible region, which is useful for
page layout.

Proprietary Syntax (Netscape 3 and 4 Only)
<spacer
align="absmiddle | absbottom | baseline | bottom |
left | middle | right | texttop | top"
height="pixels"
size="pixels"
type="block | horizontal | vertical"
width="pixels">

Element-Specific Attributes
align This attribute specifies the alignment of the spacer with respect to surrounding text.

It is used only with spacers with type="block". The default value for the align attribute
is bottom. The meanings of the align values are similar to those of the align values used
with the img element.

height This attribute specifies the height of the invisible region, in pixels. It is used only
with spacers with type="block".
size Used with type="block" and type="horizontal" spacers, this attribute sets the
spacer’s width, in pixels. Used with a type="vertical" spacer, this attribute is used to set
the spacer’s height.
type This attribute indicates the type of invisible region. A horizontal spacer adds
horizontal space between words and objects. A vertical spacer adds space between lines.
A block spacer defines a general-purpose positioning rectangle, like an invisible image that
text can flow around.
width This attribute is used only with the type="block" spacer and is used to set the
width of the region, in pixels.

Example
A line of text with two <spacer type="horizontal" size="20">words
separated by 20 pixels. Here is a line of text.<br>
<spacer type="vertical" size="50">
Here is another line of text with a large space between the two

PART I

Compatibility
No standards support

Netscape 3, 4, 4.5–4.8

Note
• This element should not be used, because even newer versions of the Netscape
browser (6 and 7) have dropped support for this element. It is presented for
historical reasons and will be dropped from the reference in the next edition of this
book.

<span>

(Text Span)

This inline element is used to group content so scripting or style rules can be applied to the
enclosed content. As it has no preset or rendering meaning, this is the most useful inline
element for associating style and script with content.

Notes
• The HTML 4.01 specification reserved the datafld, dataformatas, and datasrc
attributes for future use. They were later dropped from XHTML. Internet Explorer 4
and later continue to support these attributes for data binding.
• As a generic element, span, like div, is useful for binding style to arbitrary
content. However, span is an inline element and does not cause a return by
default as div does.

<strike>

Notes
• This tag should act the same as the <s> tag.
• This element has been deprecated by the W3C. The strict HTML and XHTML
specifications include neither the <strike> tag nor the <s> tag because it is possible
to indicate strikethrough text using the style sheet property text-decoration:
line-through. The HTML5 specification also indicates this element as obsolete.

<strong>

This inline element indicates strongly emphasized text. It usually is rendered in a bold
typeface, but its rendering is not guaranteed because it is a logical element.

<style>

(Style Information)

This element is used to surround style sheet rules for a document. This element should be
found only in the head element, though it appears HTML5 may loosen this restriction. Style
rules directly found within a document’s body generally should be set with the core style
attribute for the particular element of interest.

Syntax

• As compared to b, this element does have some logical meaning. For example, voice
browsers may speak <strong>-enclosed text in a different voice than is used for
text that is enclosed by <b>, though practically such distinction may not hold given
the need of voice browsers to act reasonably with pages not coded for them.

Element-Specific Attributes
disabled This initially Microsoft-defined attribute is used to disable a style sheet. The
presence of the attribute is all that is required to disable the style sheet. In conjunction with
scripting, this attribute could be used to turn on and off various style sheets in a document.
While not documented in later versions of Internet Explorer, this attribute is very much
supported and used, since it is part of the DOM standard. Internet Explorer may also
support values of true and false.
media This attribute specifies the destination medium for the style information. The value

of the attribute can be a single media descriptor, such as screen, or a comma-separated list.
Possible values for this attribute include all, aural, braille, print, projection,
screen, and tv. Other values also might be defined, depending on the browser. Internet
Explorer supports all, print, and screen as values for this attribute.

scoped This HTML5 Boolean attribute is used to indicate if the style sheet should be scoped;
in other words, apply only the tree it is enclosed within. For example, here we see a <style>
tag found within a <noscript> tag.

<noscript>
<style type="text/css" scoped>
h1 {color: red;}
</style>
<h1>Error: scripting required</h1>
</noscript>

With the scoped attribute present, the styling rules should be restricted solely to the
elements within the <noscript> tag; thus, other h1 elements would not be colored red.
Given the lack of implementations and some specification unclarity, page authors should
approach this attribute cautiously.

type This attribute is used to define the type of style sheet. The value of the attribute
should be the MIME type of the style sheet language used. The most common current value
for this attribute is text/css, which indicates a CSS format.
xml:space This attribute is included from XHTML 1.0 and is used to specify whether

spaces need to be preserved within the script element or the default whitespace handling
should be employed.

Notes
• Style information also can be specified in external style sheets as defined by a
<link> tag.
• Style information can also be associated with a particular element using the style
attribute.
• Style rules are often comment masked within a <style> tag to avoid interpretation
by nonconforming browsers.
<style type="text/css">
<!-body {background-color: red;}
-->
</style>

• Internet Explorer’s conditional comments also are useful to address browser
concerns. See the section “<!-- .[ ].. --> (Conditional Comment)” toward the start of
the reference.
• The meaning of some HTML5 global attributes like accesskey, contextmenu,
spellcheck, and style in particular are quite unclear for this element and may be
erroneous.

This element is used to define a table. Tables should be used to organize data. However,
they are often used to provide structure for laying out pages in the absence of CSS.

background This nonstandard attribute, which is supported by nearly every browser,

bgcolor This attribute specifies a background color for a table. Its value can be either a

named color, such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as

#FF0000.

border This attribute specifies, in pixels, the width of a table’s borders. A value of 0 makes
a borderless table, which is useful for graphics layout.
bordercolor

This attribute, supported by Internet Explorer and Netscape, is used to set the
border color for a table. The attribute should be used only with a positive value for the
border attribute. The value of the attribute can be either a named color, such as green, or a
color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #00FF00. The color
applications may be slightly different in browsers, since Netscape colors only the outer
border of the table. CSS should be used for border styling instead of this attribute.

bordercolordark This Internet Explorer–specific attribute specifies the darker of two border
colors used to create a three-dimensional effect for cell borders. It must be used with the
border attribute set to a positive value. The attribute value can be either a named color,
such as blue, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #0000FF.
CSS should be used for border styling instead of this attribute.
bordercolorlight This Internet Explorer–specific attribute specifies the lighter of two border
colors used to create a three-dimensional effect for cell borders. It must be used with the
border attribute set to a positive value. The attribute value can be either a named color,
such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #FF0000.
CSS should be used for border styling instead of this attribute.
cellpadding This attribute sets the width, in pixels, between the edge of a cell and its
content.

cellspacing This attribute sets the width, in pixels, between individual cells.
cols This attribute specifies the number of columns in the table and is used to help quickly
calculate the size of the table. This attribute was part of the preliminary specification of
HTML 4.0, but was later dropped. A few browsers, notably Netscape and Internet Explorer,
support it.

datapagesize The value of this Microsoft-specific attribute is the number of records that can
be displayed in the table when data binding is used.
frame This attribute specifies which edges of a table are to display a border frame. A value
of above indicates only the top edge; below indicates only the bottom edge; and border
and box indicate all edges, which is the default when the border attribute is a positive
integer. A value of hsides indicates only the top and bottom edges should be displayed;
lhs indicates the left edge should be displayed; rhs indicates the right edge should be

specifies the URL of a background image for the table. The image is tiled if it is smaller than
the table dimensions. Note that some early versions of Netscape display the background
image in each table cell rather than behind the complete table.

displayed; vsides indicates the left and right edges both should be displayed; and void
indicates no border should be displayed.

height This attribute specifies the height of the table, in pixels or as a percentage of the
browser window. Be careful, because some browser versions may not support percentage
values for height or may have variations in this calculation when they do support it.
hspace This Netscape-specific attribute indicates the horizontal space, in pixels, between
the table and surrounding content, similar to the same attribute on <img>.
rules This attribute controls the display of dividing rules within a table. A value of all

specifies dividing rules for rows and columns. A value of cols specifies dividing rules for
columns only. A value of groups specifies horizontal dividing rules between groups of table
cells defined by the thead, tbody, tfoot, or colgroup elements. A value of rows specifies
dividing rules for rows only. A value of none indicates no dividing rules and is the default.

summary This attribute is used to provide a text summary of the table’s purpose and

structure. This element is used for accessibility, and its presence is important for nonvisual
user agents.

vspace This Netscape attribute indicates the vertical space, in pixels, between the table and
surrounding content, similar to the same attribute on <img>.
width This attribute specifies the width of the table, either in pixels or as a percentage of
the enclosing window.

Notes
• In addition to displaying tabular data, tables have been used to support graphics
layout and design. CSS is currently the suggested method for layout, but current
inspection of sites suggests that in 2009 table-based layout is alive and well.
• The HTML 4 specification reserved the attributes datasrc, datafld,
dataformatas, and datapagesize for future versions. However, XHTML dropped
these attributes. They are supported in Internet Explorer 4 and later. Early drafts of
the HTML5 specification introduced a datagrid, which seem to revisit these ideas,
but it was later dropped with indications it may return in future versions of HTML.
• At the time of this writing, most browsers have problems with char and charoff
attributes in all table-related tags.
• The HTML 3.2 specification defines only the align, border, cellpadding,
cellspacing, and width attributes for the table element.
• The cols attribute might provide an undesirable result under some versions of
Netscape, which assumes the size of each column in the table is exactly the same.

Element-Specific Attributes
align This attribute is used to align the contents of the cells within a <tbody> tag.

Common values are center, justify, left, and right. The specification also defines a
value of char. When align is set to char, the attribute char must be present and set to the
character to which cells should be aligned. A common use of this approach would be to set
cells to align on a decimal point. Unfortunately, browsers do not support the char value for
align well.

bgcolor This attribute specifies a background color for the cells within a <tbody> tag. Its
value can be either a named color, such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal
#RRGGBB format, such as #FF0000.
char This attribute is used to define the character to which element contents are aligned
when the align attribute is set to the char value.

charoff This attribute contains an offset as a positive or negative integer to align characters
as related to the char value. A value of 2 would align characters in a cell two characters to
the right of the character defined by the char attribute.
valign This attribute is used to set the vertical alignment for the table cells within a

<tbody> tag. The HTML specification defines baseline, bottom, middle, and top.
Internet Explorer also supports center, which should act like middle.

Element-Specific Attributes
abbr The value of this attribute is an abbreviated name for a header cell. This might be
useful when attempting to display large tables on small screens. User agents rarely
implement this feature.

align This attribute is used to align the contents of the cells. Supported values are center,
justify, left, and right.

axis This attribute is used to provide a name for a group of related headers.
background This nonstandard attribute, which is supported by major browsers, specifies

the URL of a background image for the table cell. The image is tiled if it is smaller than the
cell’s dimensions.

bgcolor This attribute specifies a background color for a table cell. Its value can be either a

named color, such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as
#FF0000. Note that some older versions of Netscape Navigator may not render an empty

cell with a colored background unless some content serving as placeholder, such as a
nonbreaking space or transparent pixel-gif, is inserted in the cell.

bordercolor

This attribute, supported by Internet Explorer and Netscape, is used to set the
border color for a table cell. The attribute should be used only with a positive value for the
border attribute. The value of the attribute can be either a named color, such as green, or a
color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #00FF00.

bordercolordark This Internet Explorer–specific attribute specifies the darker of two border
colors used to create a three-dimensional effect for a cell’s borders. It must be used with the
border attribute set to a positive value. The attribute value can be either a named color,
such as blue, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #0000FF.
bordercolorlight This Internet Explorer–specific attribute specifies the lighter of two border
colors used to create a three-dimensional effect for a cell’s borders. It must be used with the
border attribute set to a positive value. The attribute value can be either a named color,
such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #FF0000.
char This attribute is used to define the character to which element contents are aligned
when the align attribute is set to the char value.

charoff This attribute contains an offset, specified as a positive or negative integer, to align
characters as related to the char value. A value of 2, for example, would align characters in
a cell two characters to the right of the character defined by the char attribute.

colspan This attribute takes a numeric value that indicates how many columns wide a cell
should be. This is useful for creating tables with cells of different widths.
header cells related to this cell.

height This attribute indicates the height of the cell, in pixels or as a percentage. Some
browsers may have rendering problems with percentage values.
nowrap This attribute keeps the content within a table cell from automatically wrapping.
The nowrap attribute takes no value under HTML but should be set to the value nowrap
under XHTML.
rowspan This attribute takes a numeric value that indicates how many rows high a table
cell should span. This attribute is useful in defining tables with cells of different heights.

scope This attribute specifies the table cells for which the current cell provides header
information. A value of col indicates that the cell is a header for the rest of the column
below it. A value of colgroup indicates that the cell is a header for its current column
group. A value of row indicates that the cell contains header information for the rest of the
row it is in. A value of rowgroup indicates that the cell is a header for its row group. This
attribute might be used in place of the header attribute and is useful for rendering
assistance by nonvisual browsers. This attribute was added very late to the HTML 4
specification, and support for this attribute is still minimal.
valign This attribute is used to set the vertical alignment for the table cell. The specification

defines baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Internet Explorer also supports center,
which should be the same as middle.

width This attribute specifies the width of a cell, in pixels or as a percentage value.

is made active. It only takes an attribute value of autofocus when using the XML-style
syntax for HTML5.

cols This attribute sets the width, in characters, of the text area. The typical default value
for the size of a <textarea> tag when this attribute is not set is 20 characters.

disabled This attribute is used to turn off a form control. Elements will not be submitted,
nor can they receive any focus from the keyboard or mouse. Disabled form controls will not
be part of the tabbing order. The browser also can gray out the form that is disabled, to
indicate to the user that the form control is inactive. This attribute requires no value.
form This HTML5 attribute should be set to a string that corresponds to the id of the form
element that an interactive control such as a button is associated with. This allows form
elements in one form to trigger actions in others.
name This attribute allows a form control to be assigned a name for submitting to the
server the appropriate name/value pair. Previously it was also used so that the field could
be referenced by a scripting language. However, it is more appropriate to use the id
attribute. For compatibility purposes, both attributes might be used and set to the same
value.
pattern This HTML5 attribute specifies a regular expression against which the field should
be validated. The title attribute should be provided when this attribute is used, to give an
indication of what is an acceptable pattern and what isn’t.
placeholder This HTML5 attribute specifies a short bit of text that is used to help the user
figure out what type of information to fill in for a form control. Likely, the text will be
placed in the field and cleared upon focus.

readonly This attribute prevents the form control’s value from being changed. Form
controls with this attribute set might receive focus from the user but should not permit the
user to modify the value. Because it receives focus, a readonly form control will be part of
the form’s tabbing order. Finally, the control’s value will be sent on form submission. Under
XHTML, the value of the readonly attribute should be set to readonly.
required The presence of this HTML5 Boolean attribute indicates that the user is required
to provide a value for the <textarea> tag for the form to be submitted. User agents that
understand this should set the CSS pseudo-class :invalid when the field goes into error.

rows This attribute sets the number of rows in the text area. The value of the attribute
should be a positive integer.
wrap

In some versions of Netscape (later Firefox) and Microsoft browsers, this attribute
controls word-wrap behavior. A value of off for the attribute forces the <textarea> tag
not to wrap text, so the viewer must manually enter line breaks. A value of hard causes

word wrap but removes line breaks from text submitted to the server. Internet Explorer

Notes
• Any text between the <textarea> and </textarea> tags is rendered as the default
entry for the form control. Content within a textarea element is not interpreted, so
white space is preserved and tags themselves are ignored.
• The textarea element traditionally lacks a maxlength attribute, which causes a
more obvious security risk. The HTML5 specification does introduce a maxlength
value to restrict the number of characters that may be entered. However, it should
be noted that all client-side form validations should be assumed as user
conveniences only and not security, as they may be easily removed by malicious
users.
• A <textarea> tag cannot be a descendent of an a (anchor) or button element.
• The HTML 4.01 specification reserves the datafld and datasrc attributes for
future use with the textarea element.
• The HTML 2.0 and 3.2 specifications define only the cols, name, and rows
attributes for this element.

<tfoot>

(Table Footer)

This element is used to group the rows within the footer of a table so that common
alignment and style defaults can easily be set for numerous cells. This element might be
particularly useful when setting a common footer for tables that are dynamically generated.

included, text will still wrap under Internet Explorer, but older versions of Netscape,
notably Netscape 4, will scroll horizontally in the text box. Given this problem, even though
it is nonstandard, it may be a good idea to include the wrap attribute. HTML5 reintroduces
this attribute with the values of hard and soft. Use of this attribute assumes that the cols
attribute has been set properly.

Element-Specific Attributes
align This attribute is used to align the contents of the cells within a <tfoot> tag.

Common values are center, justify, left, and right. The HTML and XHTML
specifications also define a value of char. When align is set to char, the attribute char
must be present and set to the character to which cells should be aligned. A common use of
this approach would be to set cells to align on a decimal point.

char This attribute is used to define the character to which element contents are aligned
when the align attribute is set to the char value.

charoff This attribute contains an offset, as a positive or negative integer, for aligning
characters as related to the char value. A value of 2, for example, would align characters in
a cell two characters to the right of the character defined by the char attribute.
valign This attribute is used to set the vertical alignment for the table cells within a

<tfoot> tag. The specification defines baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Internet
Explorer also supports center, which should be the same as middle.

Example
<table border="1" width="80%">
<tfoot align="center" class="tablefooter"
valign="bottom">
<td>This is part of the footer.</td>
<td>This is also part of the footer.</td>

Notes
• This element is contained only by the table element and contains table rows as
delimited by tr elements.
• While it would seem that this element should come after a <tbody> tag, it actually
should come before it, within a <table> tag.
• Under the XHTML 1.0 specification, the closing </tfoot> tag ceases to be optional.

<th>

(Table Header)

This element specifies a header cell in a table. The element should occur within a table row
as defined by a tr element. The main visual difference between this element and td is that
browsers might render table headers slightly differently, usually bolding and centering
contents. However, the element is logical in nature and should be used to structure tables.

align This attribute is used to align the contents of the cells within a <th> tag. Common
values are center, justify, left, and right.

axis This attribute is used to provide a name for a group of related headers.
background This nonstandard attribute, which is supported by most browsers, specifies the

URL of a background image for the table cell. The image is tiled if it is smaller than the cell’s
dimensions.

bgcolor This attribute specifies a background color for a table cell. Its value can be either a

named color, such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as

#FF0000.

bordercolor

This attribute, supported by Internet Explorer and Netscape, is used to set the
border color for a table cell. The attribute should be used only with a positive value for the
border attribute. The value of the attribute can be either a named color, such as green, or a
color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #00FF00.

bordercolordark This Internet Explorer–specific attribute specifies the darker of two border
colors used to create a three-dimensional effect for a cell’s borders. It must be used with the
border attribute set to a positive value. The attribute value can be either a named color,
such as blue, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #0000FF.
bordercolorlight This Internet Explorer–specific attribute specifies the lighter of two border
colors used to create a three-dimensional effect for a cell’s borders. It must be used with the
border attribute set to a positive value. The attribute value can be either a named color,
such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #FF0000.
char This attribute is used to define the character to which element contents are aligned
when the align attribute is set to the char value.

charoff This attribute contains an offset, specified as a positive or negative integer, for
aligning characters as related to the char value. A value of 2, for example, would align
characters in a cell two characters to the right of the character defined by the char attribute.
colspan This attribute takes a numeric value that indicates how many columns wide a cell
should be. This is useful for creating tables with cells of different widths.
headers This attribute takes a space-separated list of id values that correspond to the
header cells related to this cell.

height This attribute indicates the height of the cell, in pixels or as a percentage. Some
browsers may have rendering problems with percentage values.
nowrap This attribute keeps the content within a table cell from automatically wrapping.
The nowrap attribute takes no value under HTML but should be set to the value nowrap
under XHTML.
rowspan This attribute takes a numeric value that indicates how many rows high a table
cell should span. This attribute is useful in defining tables with cells of different heights.

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

valign This attribute is used to set the vertical alignment for the table cell. The specification

defines baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Internet Explorer also supports center,
which should be the same as middle.

width This attribute specifies the width of a cell, in pixels or as a percentage value.

Example
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Names</th>
<th>Apples</th>
<th>Oranges</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rusty</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>5</td>

Notes
• The HTML 3.2 specification defines only align, colspan, height, nowrap,
rowspan, valign, and width attributes.
• This element should always be within the tr element.
• Under the XHTML 1.0 specification, the closing </th> tag ceases to be optional.

<thead>

(Table Header)

This element is used to group the rows within the header of a table so that common alignment
and style defaults can easily be set for numerous cells. This element might be particularly
useful when setting a common head for tables that are dynamically generated.

PART I

scope This attribute specifies the table cells for which the current cell provides header
information. A value of col indicates that the cell is a header for the rest of the column
below it. A value of colgroup indicates that the cell is a header for its current column
group. A value of row indicates that the cell contains header information for the rest of the
row it is in. A value of rowgroup indicates that the cell is a header for its row group. This
attribute can be used in place of the header attribute and is useful for rendering assistance
by nonvisual browsers. This attribute was added very late to the HTML 4.0 specification,
and support for this attribute is still minimal in browsers.

Element-Specific Attributes

YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD

where the following is true:
YYYY=four-digit year such as 1999
MM=two-digit month (01=January, 02=February, and so on.)
DD=two-digit day of the month (01 through 31)
hh=two-digit hour (00 to 23) (24-hour clock, not AM or PM)
mm=two-digit minute (00 through 59)
ss=two-digit second (00 through 59)
TZD=time zone designator

The time zone designator is either Z, which indicates Universal Time Coordinate or
coordinated universal time format (UTC), or +hh:mm, which indicates that the time is a local
time that is hh hours and mm minutes ahead of UTC. Alternatively, the format for the time
zone designator could be -hh:mm, which indicates that the local time is behind UTC. Note
that the letter T actually appears in the string, all digits must be used, and 00 values for
minutes and seconds might be required. An example value for the datetime attribute
might be 1999-10-6T09:15:00-05:00, which corresponds to October 6, 1999, 9:15 A.M.,
U.S. Eastern Standard Time.

pubdate This Boolean attribute, when specified, indicates that the date and time given
by this element should be applied as the publication date of an enclosing article element.
If there is no enclosing article element, the publication date would apply to the entire
document. Under XHTML5, the value of the attribute should be pubdate for XML syntax
conformance.

Examples
<p>My son was born on <time datetime="2006-01-13">Friday the 13th</time> so
it is my new lucky day.</p>
<p>Today it is <time>2010-07-08</time> which is an interesting date.</p>
<p>When did the Moon runaway? <time>1999-09-13T09:15:00-05:00</time></p>

Not currently supported by any browser, but addressed via a custom element.

Notes
• This element should contain content that is in the correct format unless the
datetime attribute is used. Of course, browsers aren’t going to enforce this, but it is
important if you want correct HTML5 conformance.
• This element is not yet implemented in any browser. However, given that most
browsers can handle custom elements, it would be easy enough to simulate the idea
of it directly or use a <span> tag with a custom class.

<title>

(Document Title)

This element encloses the title of an HTML document. It must occur within a document’s
head element and must be present in all valid documents. There should be only a single
occurrence of this element. Meaningful titles are very important because they are used for
bookmarking a page, are occasionally used by browsers to label locally saved pages, and
are often used by search engines attempting to index the document.

Notes
• Often, the title is set as the first element found in the head, though it should come
after a character set indication if that is not taken care of by appropriate HTTP
headers.
• Meaningful names should provide information about the document. A poor title
would be something like “My Home Page,” whereas a better title would be “Joe
Smith Home.”
• Browsers can be extremely sensitive to the <title> tag. If the title element is
malformed or not closed, the page might not even render in the browser.
• The HTML 2.0 and 3.2 specifications define no attributes for the title element.
• Under most browsers, core HTML 4 attribute values like id and class will work
for DOM access and make some sense for manipulation via JavaScript, but other
attributes for events or style-related features do not.
• The title element may contain character entities to set accents or introduce other
special characters, though you should use caution to make sure the appropriate
character set has been defined. Markup may not be included in the title element.
• Currently, the HTML5 specification defines all the common attributes for the title
element, like accesskey, class, contextmenu, and so on. Their context, however,
seems inappropriate given how browsers work. For example, while it is possible to
imagine a tabbing order or context menu for a browser title, so far such things are
unclear and suggest an over generalization of the HTML5 specification when it
comes to global attributes.

Element-Specific Attributes
align This attribute is used to align the contents of the cells within the element. Common

values are center, justify, left, and right. If a value is set to char, alignment is set to
align off the character defined by the char attribute, with offset applied by charoffset.

bgcolor This attribute specifies a background color for all the cells in a row. Its value can be
either a named color, such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format,
such as #FF0000.

bordercolor

This attribute, supported by a number of browsers, including Internet Explorer,
is used to set the border color for table cells in the row. The attribute should be used only
with a positive value for the border attribute. The value of the attribute can be either a
named color, such as green, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such
as #00FF00. CSS should be used instead.

bordercolordark This Internet Explorer–specific attribute specifies the darker of two border
colors used to create a three-dimensional effect for the cell’s borders. It must be used with
the border attribute set to a positive value. The attribute value can be either a named color,
such as blue, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #0000FF.
CSS should be used instead.
bordercolorlight This Internet Explorer–specific attribute specifies the lighter of two border
colors used to create a three-dimensional effect for a cell’s borders. It must be used with the
border attribute set to a positive value. The attribute value can be either a named color,
such as red, or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format, such as #FF0000.
CSS should be used instead.
char This attribute is used to define the character to which element contents are aligned
when the align attribute is set to the char value.

Core Markup

charoff This attribute contains an offset, specified as a positive or negative integer, for
aligning characters as related to the char value. A value of 2, for example, would align
characters in a cell two characters to the right of the character defined by the char attribute.
valign This attribute is used to set the vertical alignment for the table cells with a <tr> tag.
The specification defines baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Internet Explorer also
allows center, which should be the same as middle.

Example
<table width="300" border="1">
<tr align="center" valign="middle">
<td>3</td>
<td>5.6</td>
<td>7.9</td>

Notes
• This tag is contained only in the <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> tags. It
contains the <th> and <td> tags.
• The HTML 3.2 specification defines only the align and valign attributes for this
element.
• Internet Explorer 6 introduced ch and choff attributes per a draft standard at the
time, but they do not do anything and later are set as char and charoff.
• CSS visual changes to tables are suggested, but many sites claim that under strict
variants the various attributes like bgcolor no longer work. Testing in modern
browsers (IE 8, Firefox 3) at the time this edition was written does not support these
claims.
• Under the XHTML 1.0 specification, the closing </tr> tag is required, but under
older HTML and HTML5, the closing tag is optional.
• There are extended DOM methods for table-related tags like <tr>, including
insertRow() and deleteRow().

<tt>

(Teletype Text)

This inline element is used to indicate that text should be rendered in a monospaced font
similar to teletype text. The element is being marked as obsolete or deprecated and should
be avoided in favor of CSS.

Element-Specific Attributes
compact This attribute indicates that the list should be rendered in a compact style. Few
browsers actually change the rendering of the list, regardless of the presence of this
attribute. The compact attribute requires no value unless it is used with XML-style syntax,
where it takes the value of compact.
type The type attribute is used to set the bullet style for the list. The values defined under
HTML 3.2 and the transitional version of HTML and XHTML are circle, disc, and
square. A user agent might decide to use a different bullet depending on the nesting level
of the list, unless the type attribute is used. The type attribute is dropped under the strict
versions of HTML 4 and XHTML because style sheets can provide richer bullet control
using the list-style-type and list-style-image properties.

Examples
<ul compact="compact" title="Sushi Short List" type="circle">
<li>Maguro</li>
<li>Ebi</li>
<li>Hamachi</li>
</ul>
<!-- Correct list nesting -->

Notes
• HTML 2.0 supports only the compact attribute.
• The HTML 3.2 specification supports compact and type.
• Under the strict (X)HTML specifications as well as HTML5, the ul element does not
support the compact attribute or the type attribute. Both of these attributes can be
easily replaced with CSS properties.
• Due to XHTML’s deprecation of attribute minimization, the compact attribute must
have a quoted attribute when used in the transitional variant:
<ul compact="compact"></ul>

• Many Web page designers and page development tools use the <ul> tag to indent
text. The only element that should occur within a ul element is li, so such markup
does not conform to standards. However, this common practice is likely to continue.
• Since the content model of ul says list items should be the only item within <ul>
tags, nested lists should occur within <li> tags rather than outside them as they are
commonly found.

<var> (Variable)
This logical inline element is used to indicate a variable (an identifier that occurs in a
programming language or a mathematical expression), with any enclosed text generally
rendered in italics.

Element-Specific Attributes
autobuffer This Boolean attribute indicates the browser should begin buffering a video

right away. This attribute should be used if it is assumed the user will play the video. This
attribute is meaningful only if autoplay is not set, as in that case the browser will play
video as soon as it can, allowing no time for further buffering.

autoplay This Boolean attribute indicates the browser should begin playing a video after
page load once enough content has been received and it is reasonable to play without
interruptions.
controls This Boolean attribute is set to indicate whether or not the browser should present
controls for video, such as playback, pause, volume, and seek. If not present, no controls
will be shown and it will be up to the developer to script the control of the video element.
loop This Boolean attribute, if present, indicates that the video should loop.
poster This attribute is set to the URL of an image that the browser will use in place of the
video before it is loaded and playing.
src

This attribute is set to the URL of the video to show.

Examples
<video src="movies/movie1.ogg" autoplay>
<p>No support for HTML5 <code>video</code> element.</p>

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

• Flash video will often be used to avoid cross-browser rendering concerns. Until this
element is widely supported, developers are advised to continue using Flash video.

<wbr>

(Word Break)

This nonstandard element is used to indicate a place where a line break can occur if
necessary. This element is used in conjunction with the nobr element, which is used to keep
text from wrapping. When used this way, wbr can be thought of as a soft line break in
comparison to a <br> tag. This element is common to many earlier browsers, though it is
not part of any HTML standard.

Proprietary Syntax
<wbr
id="unique alphanumeric value">

Examples
<nobr>A line break can occur here<wbr>but not elsewhere, even if
the line is really long.</nobr>
<nobr>For comparison a line break cannot occur here even if the
line is really long like this one is.</nobr>

Compatibility
No standards support

Internet Explorer 2–7, Netscape 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 4.5–4.8

Notes
• Early versions of standards-based browsers, such as Mozilla and Opera, do not
support this tag but, oddly, seem to support <nobr>. However, later versions,
including IE 8, correctly ignore this feature.
• To simulate this element’s functionality for setting a soft break in modern browsers
that apply white-space: nowrap to an element, use the tag as a custom tag and
set its style like so: <wbr style="display:inline-block;>. Other schemes
using the &shy; and &#8203; entities may provide useful functionality as well in
some cases.
• Documentation for older versions of Internet Explorer defined class, language,
style, and title for this tag. However, they have little meaning, given this tag’s
purpose, and have since been eliminated from the documentation, though they may
effectively be recognized in some manner by the browser parser.
• Though this is an empty element and should be written as <wbr /> under XHTML,
it does not need to be. It is not standard and will not validate anyway.

PART I

• Browsers are quite variable in what codecs they support. For example, Firefox 3.5
supports Theora for video in Ogg containers, while Safari browsers favor
QuickTime movies.

<xml>

(XML Data Island)

This proprietary element introduced by Microsoft can be used to insert fragments of XML
(Extensible Markup Language) data into HTML documents. This idea is generally called
data islands and natively will work only under Internet Explorer 5.0 or later. However, it
can be simulated using JavaScript and careful style sheet applications in other browsers.
Under Internet Explorer, an <xml> tag can be used to reference outside data sources using
the src attribute, or to surround XML data in the (X)HTML document itself.

Internet Explorer Syntax
<xml
id="unique alphanumeric value"
src="URL of XML data file">
...embedded XML markup...
</xml>

Events Defined by Internet Explorer
ondataavailable, ondatasetchanged, ondatasetcomplete, onreadystatechange,
onrowenter, onrowexit, onrowsdelete, onrowsinserted

Element-Specific Attribute
src

This attribute references an external XML data file.

Examples
<!-- This code embeds XML data directly into a document.
All code between the <xml> tags is not HTML, but a
hypothetical example of XML. -->
<xml id="tasty">
<combomeal>
<burger>
<name>Tasty Burger</name>
<bun bread="white">
<meat />
<cheese />
<meat />
</bun>
</burger>
<fries size="large" />
<drink size="large" flavor="Cola" />
</combomeal>

<!-- This code fragment uses the src attribute to reference an
external file containing XML data. -->
<xml src="combomeal.xml"></xml>

Chapter 3:

HTML and XHTML Element Reference

425

Compatibility
No standards support

Internet Explorer 5+

• Native browser support for the <xml> tag is limited to Internet Explorer 5 or later,
though given native support for XML in modern browsers, it is possible to simulate
the idea by defining a custom tag and hiding it using CSS display or visibility
properties. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_XML_Data_Islands_in_
Mozilla for an example.

Introduction to CSS

I

n the past, much of the visual formatting of Web pages was supplied by markup
elements, squarely mixing the concepts of logical and physical markup into the mess
that is classic HTML. Strict variants of (X)HTML deprecated the elements and attributes
that focused on presentation, providing a clear distinction between the structure provided
by markup and the look dictated by a style sheet written in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
syntax. The distinct division of duties between markup and style can provide numerous
production, maintenance, and even performance benefits, making it a far superior
presentation solution to markup alone.

Presentational HTML
Traditionally, for right or wrong, markup has been used for formatting. For example, many
HTML elements support the align attribute, which provides simple support for text
alignment. Combine these aspects of markup with the assumption of visual rendering, such
as the belief that h1 elements always should make text big, and it would actually seem clear
to some that HTML is meant for formatting, as demonstrated here:
<h1 align="center">Big Centered Text!</h1>

Now an argument can be made about the semantic value of the h1 specifying a
headline, but for those solely coming at HTML from a point of view of knowing what a tag
does, the idea that an <h1> tag makes something big wins out. Yet, beyond such
misunderstandings based upon observation rather than the intent of the specification, there
are elements that are strictly presentational, like font, which is part of HTML 3.2, 4.01
transitional, and XHTML 1.0 transitional specifications:
<font size="7" color="red">I am big and red!</font>

Further, when looking at browser-specific elements, plenty of presentational markup
can be found. For example, the following markup
<blink>Proprietary HTML Tag Sale: 50% Off for Firefox Users!</blink>

429

430

Part II:

Core Style

creates blinking text in Firefox, while this markup
<marquee>Sale! Sale! Sale! All Presentation Tags Must Go!!!</marquee>

animates text in nearly any browser. History has already been written. Like it or not,
markup has been used to visually present Web pages for well over a decade.
The problem with using HTML for formatting is that it just isn’t really very good at it,
nor was it generally designed for it. For example, just to make some centered red text with a
yellow background, you’d likely resort to using markup like so:
<table align="center" width="100%">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="yellow" align="center">
<font size="7"
color="red"
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Big Red HTML Text
</font>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

When using HTML for Web page presentation, we see a tremendous amount of markup
being used to style the page, often filled with complex stacked or even nested tables. Layout
workarounds using invisible pixel images, proprietary elements and attributes, text in images,
and other arcane ideas were, and often still are, required to deliver quality, high-fidelity
design in HTML. Fortunately, for now and the future, there is a better way—style sheets.

The Slow Rise of CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) offers what Web designers have been
clamoring for over the years: more control over layout. Interestingly, the excitement about
CSS has been quite slow to build. CSS1 marked its first appearance as a standard in late
1996 and CSS2 quickly followed in 1998. Early browsers such as Internet Explorer 3 and
Netscape 4 supported some of the technology, but CSS has had trouble gaining widespread
acceptance. Browser support has been quite inconsistent, and significant bugs, particularly
in older of versions of Internet Explorer, have made the use of CSS a lesson in frustration.
For visual proof of this, consider the CSS2 conformance tests called Acid2 (www.acidtests
.org/), which exercises many important features of CSS1 and CSS2. Figure 4-1 shows
Internet Explorer 6 and Firefox 2 both failing this test. However, with the release of Internet
Explorer 8 and Firefox 3 and past conformance of other browsers like Opera and Safari, all
the major browsers now pass the Acid2 test (see Figure 4-2). Considering that the
introduction of that test was in 2005 and for many years previous CSS support was spotty,
finally we see that CSS is changing for the better!

NOTE As this edition goes to print, many browsers pass Acid3 as well. The point here is to show

that in the past few years CSS has become viable and appropriate, and that it took a while to get
there, rather than to declare any browser a winner or loser in a standards race.

FIGURE 4-1

Older browsers failing Acid2

Newer versions of browsers are far better than their predecessors, and now have good
support for CSS1 and CSS 2.1 as well as many features from CSS3. Yet even as CSS support
has become more commonplace, significant issues remain. Browser bugs still exist, portions
of the CSS specification remain unsupported, developer education and uptake is lagging,
and proprietary extensions to style sheets are rapidly being introduced by browser vendors.
It seems the more things change the more they stay the same regardless of the technology in
use. HTML wonks who have spent time addressing quirks and workarounds will find plenty
of new ones to address in the world of CSS. We’ll return to this sad fact at the end of the
chapter when we discuss the pragmatic use of CSS, but now let’s take our first look at CSS.

432

First Look at CSS
CSS rules are defined as a property name followed by a colon and then a property value.
Individual rules are terminated by semicolons, with the final rule having an optional
semicolon:
property-name1 : value1; ... property-nameN : valueN;

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

433

CSS rules can be placed directly within most (X)HTML tags by setting the core attribute
style to the rule. For example, to set the color and alignment of an h1 heading, we might use
<h1 style="color: red; text-align: center;">Big Red CSS Text!</h1>

selector {property1 : value1; ... propertyN : valueN;}

An example rule conforming to correct CSS syntax broken out into its individual
components is shown here:

Value

Property Name

Declaration Separation

h1 {font-size: xx-large; color: red;}
Declaration
Selector

Declaration

Rule

Declaration Block

NOTE The final declaration in a style rule block does not require the semicolon. However, for good

measure and easy insertion of future properties, page authors should always use semicolons after
all style properties.

CSS property names are separated by dashes when they are multiple words—for
example, font-face, font-size, line-height, and so on. Allowed values come in many
forms; from simple keywords like xx-small, strings like "Arial", plain numbers like 0,
numbers with units like 100px or 2cm, and special delimited values such as URLs, url(../
styles/fancy.css).
Given this brief CSS syntax overview, to create a style dictating that all h1 elements are
red and centered, use the following rule:
h1

{color: red; text-align: center;}

As rules are added, you may take advantage of the fact that CSS is not terribly
whitespace sensitive, so
h1 {font-size:xx-large;color:red;font-family:Arial;}

PART II

Such direct use of CSS is called inline style and is the least favorable form of CSS because of
its tight coupling to the actual (X)HTML tags.
Instead of placing rules directly within markup elements, we might more appropriately
create a rule that binds to a particular element or set of elements, which will lend itself for
future reuse. CSS rules not found within a particular tag consist of a selector followed by its
associated style declarations within curly braces. Similar to being used inline, a style rule is
composed of property names and property values separated by colons, with each style
declaration (property/value pair) in turn being separated by a semicolon. In general, the
syntax is

434

Part II:

Core Style

will render the same as
h1 {font-size: xx-large;
color:red;
font-family:Arial;}

Given the nature of white space in CSS, you may find formatting leads to better
readability for future development. Also like traditional coding, we should add comments
using the common programming language syntax /*
*/ like so:
/* first CSS rule below */
h1 {font-size: 28px; color: red; font-family: Arial;}

Of course, when publishing CSS and HTML on public-facing Web sites, removing
comments and reducing white space to improve delivery and slightly obfuscate execution
may be appropriate.
Lastly, case should be well considered. In CSS, property names and many values are
case insensitive, so
h1 {FONT-SIZE:28px;color:RED;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;}

and
h1 {font-size:28px;color:red;font-weight:bold;}

are the same. However, in some important cases, such as with URL values, font names, and
certain selectors such as id and class values, case will be enforced. For example,
#foo {background-image url(tile.gif); font-family: Arial;}

and
#FOO {background-image url(TILE.GIF); font-family: ARIaL;}

will not necessarily be the same, with the URL sometimes working depending on the Web
server involved, the fonts potentially not matching, and the differing id selectors possibly
not working unless an extremely permissive browser is in play. Given the potential for
confusion, it is much safer to assume that CSS is case sensitive.
When not placed directly inline, style rules would be placed either within a <style> tag
found in the document head
<style type="text/css">
/* a sample style sheet */
h1
{color: red; text-align: center;}
p
{line-height: 150%;}
</style>

or will be externalized and referenced via a <link> tag found in the head of the document,
like so:
<link href="mystyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

435

Given that link would be an empty element if we were using XHTML as our base
document, the <link> tag requires the trailing slash:
<link href="mystyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

The external style sheet would solely contain CSS rules, and no HTML markup would be
found. A small example here illustrates this:
/* mystyle.css - a sample style sheet */
h1
{color: red; text-align: center;}
p
{line-height: 150%;}

<h1 id="primaryHeadline">CSS Works Fine!</h1>

Now that the tag is named, we can bind a style rule just for it by using a #id-value
selector like so:
#primaryHeadline

{color: black; font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bold;}

The values for id must be unique, so in order to affect a select group of tags, we relate
them by setting their class attribute to the same value:
<p class="fancy">I’m fancy!</p>
<p>Poor me I am a plain paragraph.</p>
<p>I am not completely fancy, but <span class="fancy">part of me
is</span>!</p>

Notice that we utilized a <span> tag around a portion of content we desired to style.
We’ll see generic elements like span and div commonly employed with CSS. Now to bind a
rule to the elements in the class fancy, we use a selector of the form .class-name like so:
.fancy {background-color: orange; color: black; font-style: italic;}

There is nothing that keeps an element from being identified with both an id and a
class attribute. Further, it is not required that a tag be found in only one class, as shown
here:

<p id="p1" class="fancy modernLook2">This unique paragraph called p1
will sport a fancy and modern look.</p>

PART II

To build a style sheet, we need to define the rules that select elements and apply various
style properties to them. Besides element selectors, previously introduced, the two most
common forms of CSS rules are id selectors, which are used to specify a rule to bind to a
particular unique element, and class selectors, which are used to specify a group of
elements.
Elements are named in (X)HTML using the id attribute, which is found on nearly any
element. As an example, here we identify a particular <h1> tag as the primary headline of
the document:

436

Part II:

Core Style

Given that many rules may be applied at once, the final style applied to a particular
element may not be immediately obvious. In fact, in quite a number of cases, the properties
affecting an element’s look may be inherited from an enclosing parent element. As a very
simple example, consider the following rules:
<style type="text/css">
body
{background-color: white; color: black;}
p
{font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif;
line-height: 150%;}
.intro
{font-style: italic;}
#firstPara {background-color: yellow;}
</style>

When the preceding is applied to a paragraph like
<p id="firstPara" class="intro">Paragraph text goes here.</p>

it produces a paragraph with a yellow background and black, Arial, italicized text that is
spaced with a 150 percent line height. What has happened is that the various rules are
applied by selectors, and some property values are inherited from their enclosing parent
elements. Using a small parse tree, Figure 4-3 shows just how the rules cascade downward
to the enclosed elements, which explains the motivation behind the name Cascading Style
Sheets.
In some cases, rules are even overridden by later-defined or more-precise rules that may
even be within inline styles.
Clearly, determining what rules apply to a particular tag can be a bit tricky, but as a rule of
thumb, the more specific the rule, the more recently defined the rule, and the closer to the tag
the rule is, the more powerful it is. For example, an inline style property would beat a value in
a document-wide style rule, while a document-wide style rule would beat a previously
defined linked style rule. Further, rules using an id would beat rules using a class, which
would beat rules based upon elements. Of course, all this can be overridden using an
!important indicator at the end of a particular declaration, so here
<style type="text/css">
#hulk {color: green !important; font-size: xx-large !important;}
</style>

the element with an id value of 'hulk' should be big and green. Though that too can be
overridden with subsequent rules setting these properties with !important. Given the
potential confusion of what rules are being applied at what times, CSS developers should
utilize a tool that can show the rendered style of an element upon inspection, as shown in
Figure 4-4.
There is plenty more to come with understanding the cascade, inheritance, and all the
various selectors. For now, with our brief introduction out of the way, it is time to see our
first style sheet in action.

Core Style

While two technologies are required to make the example, note that CSS when well
executed is both distinct from an HTML document and dependent on it. CSS is not a
replacement for markup; it in fact relies on it. As an example, if an HTML document is
malformed—the tags are not closed properly or other mistakes were made—the CSS may
not attach properly and the look would be distorted. However, mistakes can also be made
in the CSS rules, which tend to be a bit more strictly interpreted by browsers and thus may
similarly result in a visual rendering problem. Clearly, a symbiotic relationship exists
between CSS and HTML, but that relationship has changed over time, so that evolution is
described next.

CSS Versions
Cascading Style Sheets is a fairly old technology as far as the Web is concerned. The first
ideas about CSS were presented as early as 1994, and by December of 1996 the CSS1
specification (www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/) was ratified. This early version of CSS was
partially supported in browsers like Internet Explorer 3 and Netscape 4 to varying degrees.
While the features of CSS1 were far superior to what presentation HTML had with its
<font> tags and workarounds, uptake was slow.
CSS1 provided many features to change borders, margins, backgrounds, colors, and a
variety of text characteristics, but the much demanded ability to directly position objects was
absent. An interim specification on positioning HTML elements commonly called CSS-P for
short (www.w3.org/TR/WD-positioning-19970819) was implemented in Netscape 4 and
Internet Explorer 4 and later rolled into CSS2 (www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/),
which was released in May 1998. While CSS2 introduced many valuable features, including
positioning, media types for style sheets, aural style sheets, and much more, not everything has
been implemented even in the most modern browsers. A revision of this specification, CSS 2.1
(www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/), released in 2007, removed a number of unimplemented features
and normalized the specification to a more realistic vision of what browsers actually do.
While the future is clearly CSS3 (www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work#CSS3) with its
multitude of modules for addressing color, device constraints, foreign language rendering,
improved printing, and more, it is far from clear when that future will arrive. At the time of this
edition’s writing, select features of various CSS3 modules have been implemented in some
browsers, but, save for a few high-value features like the opacity property, full crossbrowser support is still spotty. Table 4-1 summarizes the version history of CSS.

Proprietary CSS
For some Web developers, CSS is associated with standards and specification, but the reality
is that, like markup, it too has proprietary features. All browser vendors have introduced
some feature or another to improve what their browser could do. Many of these features are
previews of what is likely to be implemented in the eventual CSS3 specification, but for
now they are proprietary.
Unlike (X)HTML, CSS makes it easy for browser vendors to extend the specification, as
newly introduced keywords and property names that start with a hyphen “-” or underscore
“_” are considered vendor-specific extensions. The syntax is -vendoridentifier-newproperty or
_vendoridentifier-newproperty, though in practice the hyphenated names appear to be the
only extensions in use. As an example, -moz is used to prefix Mozilla features like -mozborder-radius. A list of prefixes that are commonly seen is shown in Table 4-2.

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

Description

CSS1

Classic CSS implementation that introduced text, list, box, margin, border, color,
and background properties. Initially defined in 1996, most every feature of CSS1
is supported in Web browsers, but small quirks do exist around some lesser-used
features like white-space, letter-spacing, display, and others. Some
problems with CSS1 support are more significant in older, pre–Internet Explorer 7
browsers.

CSS2

Specification that is primarily known for positioning and media, particularly print
style sheet features. Many aspects of CSS2, such as aural style sheets, were never
widely implemented and were removed in a later iteration of the CSS specification.

CSS 2.1

A revision of the CSS2 specification that makes some corrections and is normalized
to more clearly represent what most browser vendors have implemented. Note that
many CSS2 features removed from this specification are found in CSS3 modules.
This is currently the recommended CSS specification for study and use.

CSS3

Modularized specification of CSS. Various modules extend and improve aspects
of previous CSS versions; for example, the CSS3 Color module addresses color
correction, transparency, and more, while the CSS3 Fonts module addresses
features to add effects to fonts, adjust their display, and even download custom
fonts. Some modules are all new, like the Transitions and Animations modules,
and others are quite old looking with activity levels suggesting they are abandoned
or near abandon. Whatever the situation, when it comes to CSS3, readers are
encouraged to check the CSS3 Web site and test support carefully.

There are other propriety CSS prefixes that may be encountered, which may or may not
follow the appropriate prefixing scheme. For example, wireless phones that support WAP
(Wireless Application Protocol) may use -wap- prefix based properties such as –wapaccesskey. Some implementations of Microsoft Office may use CSS rules like mso-, such
as mso-header-data. Do note that this syntax lacks the appropriate extension character
indicator. In general, it would seem that extensions should be avoided if possible unless
their presentation degrades gracefully, particularly since their compatibility and future
support by browsers or standards bodies is far from clear. Interestingly, many extension
properties appear to be CSS3 properties with stems just waiting for the specifications to
catch up. Chapter 6 will show this to be the case in numerous instances.

CSS Relationship with Markup
As CSS relies on markup and in some cases overlaps with older features provided by markup
elements, it is important to understand the relationship between the two technologies. In
general, transitional versions of (X)HTML markup include some presentational elements that
may be utilized by Web developers in place of CSS, while strict variants of (X)HTML may
eliminate such elements solely in favor of CSS properties. As an example, to center a heading
tag, the align attribute might be used like so:
<h1 align="center">Headline Centered</h1>

In the case of strict markup, however, the align attribute is deprecated and thus CSS
should be employed. This could be accomplished either using an inline style like so
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Headline Centered</h1>

or, more appropriately, with some CSS rule applied via class, id, or element selector. Here
we use a class rule
h1.centered {text-align: center;}

which would apply to tags with class values containing “centered” like the following:
<h1 class="centered">Centered Headline</h1>
<h1 class="fancy centered">Another Centered Headline</h1>

In some cases, we find that various HTML elements simply are no longer necessary in
the presence of CSS. For example, instead of tags like <u>, <sub>, <sup>, <font>, and
others, CSS rules are used often with generic elements like div or span. Table 4-3 details
most of the (X)HTML markup elements or attributes deprecated in strict variants and
presents their CSS alternatives.
There are other cases, like <sub>, <sup>, <big>, <small>, and many more, where we
could avoid using markup and apply style. The various markup specifications have not
deprecated every presentational-like element, and even if CSS alleviates the need for some
presentational elements, their usage stubbornly lives on. For that simple fact, these elements
and their equivalents are presented in this book. In fact, the continued inclusion of presentation
ideas in the emerging HTML5 specification tends to suggest that despite a desire to move to
a purely semantic markup world, while certainly worthwhile, this is unlikely to come to pass
on the Web at large, at least not rapidly.

TABLE 4-3 Common (X)HTML Structures Moved to CSS

The Specification of CSS
CSS 2.1 has a grammar (www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html) but unlike traditional
(X)HTML it is not defined with a document type definition. Instead the CSS specification is
a combination of prose and a grammar that could be used to build a simple parser. For
example, when looking at the grammar for a set of style rules, we see
ruleset
: selector [ COMMA S* selector ]*
LBRACE S* declaration [ ';' S* declaration ]* '}' S*

PART II

(X)HTML Tags or Attributes

443

444

Part II:

Core Style

Roughly, this says that a ruleset contains a selector of some sort, a curly left brace (LBRACE),
a declaration or a set of declarations followed by a semicolon, and then a closing right brace.
This basically defines the rule syntax we have seen earlier, repeated again here:
selector {property1 : value1; ... propertyN : valueN;}

Now if you continue to read the specification, you can see that selectors are then defined by
selector
: simple_selector [ combinator simple_selector ]*
;

which in turn references a simple_selector, which would include some of the types of
selectors like element names, class, and id values we have seen earlier. The production
rule of CSS grammar here shows just that:
simple_selector
: element_name [ HASH | class | attrib | pseudo ]*
| [ HASH | class | attrib | pseudo ]+
;

Yet as you expand the grammar, you should see what appears to be ambiguity. For
example, when you expand to an element_name, it will indicate that a wildcard value of
“*” can be used to match an element and then simply a value of IDENT, shown here:
element_name
: IDENT | '*'
;

IDENT will resolve to another part of the specification that defines a valid token that is a
fairly large range of strings. Simply put, the element_name selector can be just about
anything, which makes perfect sense because CSS can be used for not just HTML but also
for arbitrary XML languages, which could have a variety of possible tags. Given the wide
possibility of usage for CSS, this ambiguity is somewhat to be expected, but even the
various property names and values are not directly spelled out in the grammar and are left
to the prose of the specification. In fact, the forward-looking nature of the CSS specification
gives some latitude here in terms of such values instead of specifying the rules for what a
browser should do when faced with properties or values it doesn’t understand, as discussed
in the next section.
The various aspects of the CSS grammar that are a bit ambiguous are so not because of
some oversight but due to the intersection between CSS and other technologies. For example,
consider the situation of case sensitivity, as previously discussed in the chapter. CSS property
names and many values will be case insensitive, so font-size and FONT-SIZE are both
okay as are declarations like font-size: RED and font-size: red. Even selectors may
not be case sensitive; for example,
H1 {color: red;}

should be the same as
h1 {color: red;}

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

445

because HTML elements can vary in case. However, in the case of XML elements like
MYTAG {color: red;}

and
mytag {color: red;}

CSS Error Handling
As discussed in the previous chapter, the use of syntactically correct markup is certainly not
encouraged by permissive browser parsers that correct mistakes or guess intent when faced
with malformed markup. The situation for CSS is a bit better, and the CSS 2.1 specification does
describe what browsers should do in the case of various errors (www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/
syndata.html#parsing-errors), but then again, making the assumption that browsers are not
permissive and correctly implement all aspects of Web specifications is dangerous.

Unknown Properties

If an unknown property is encountered, a CSS-conforming user agent should ignore the
declaration. Given
h1 {color: red; trouble: right-here;}

the property trouble would simply be ignored and the rule would simply set the color. It
does not matter what the position of the bogus property declaration is, the result should be
the same as long as the declaration is otherwise well formed.
h1 {trouble: right-here; color: red;}

The case is obviously different if the various separators are missing.

Malformed Rules

In the case where semicolons (;), colons (:), quotes ('or"), or curly braces ( { } ) are misused,
a browser should try to handle any unexpected characters and read the properties until
a matching value can be found. As an example, consider the simple case of forgetting a
semicolon:
h1 {color: red text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;}

In this case, we should see the browser continue to parse the value of color as “red textdecoration: underline” before it sees a closing semicolon. The font-style property that

these wouldn’t necessarily be the same. Similarly, given the intersection of JavaScript, which
is case sensitive, id and class names should be considered to be case sensitive. Depending
on the server being used, portions of URL values, including the path and filename, may also
be case sensitive. So, the rules of CSS can cause much confusion because they are highly
influenced by its context of use. There are clear cases, however, that syntax is incorrect or at
least not understood by the parsing user-agent; fortunately, the CSS specification spells out
what ought to be done in such situations, though this assumes browser vendors follow the
specification!

Part II:

Core Style

follows would then be used. Because the color property has an illegal value, it should be
ignored.
Other cases are a bit more obvious. For example, here we see the colon missing in a style
rule declaration:
h1 {color red; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;}

In this case, the color property is simply ignored and the text is underlined and italic.
The situation for quotes and braces is the same, with compliant browsers working to
find a matching closing character for any open construct, potentially destroying anything in
between. Consider this set of rules, where quite a large amount of style may be lost:
h1 {color: green; font-family: "Super Font;}
h2 {color: orange;}
h3 {color: blue; font-family: "Duper Font";}

Be careful, though, because in this case you might assume that the rule closes off with a
quote, but that may introduce more open construct errors later on in the style sheet.

Unclosed Structures and End of File

A CSS browser should close all braces and quotes when it reaches the end of a style sheet.
While quite permissive, this would suggest that
<style type="text/css">
h1 {color: green
</style>

should render properly, as the open rule would be closed automatically by the end of the
style sheet. Open quotes would also be closed in a similar manner when the end of the style
sheet is reached. Testing reveals this action is actually the case in browsers, but creating a
syntactically correct style sheet is obviously far superior than understanding the expected
failures of a conformant browser.

Illegal or Unknown Property Values

CSS-conforming browsers must ignore a declaration with an illegal value. For example,
h1 {font-size: microscopic; color: red;}

would simply not set the font-size value but h1 elements would be red. Usage of illegal
characters can turn what would appear to be a correct value into an incorrect one. For
example,
h1 {color: "green";}

is incorrect not because green is an illegal color, but because it is not the same as the
keyword green when it is quoted.
Do not assume that a CSS-compliant browser will fix such small oversights. For
example, a browser given
h1 {color: green forest;}

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

447

should not use green but instead ignore the whole rule. Of course, what browser vendors
actually do in the face of malformed Web documents varies.

Incorrect @ Keywords and Media Values

When an @ media value or media type for a <style> tag is used, incorrect values should be
ignored. For example, if you specify <style type="text/css" media="tri-corder">,
the browser is supposed to ignore the entire <style> block unless it understands such an
odd type. Media types will be discussed in depth later, but for now understand that when
faced with syntax problems, a CSS-compliant browser should simply ignore anything
related to misunderstood values.
When style sheets are linked rather than placed within the page, the browser must apply all
types it is able to fetch and simply ignore those it can’t. So if you had
<link rel="stylesheet" href="global.css" type="text/css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="pagelevel.css" type="text/css">

and the first was fetched by the browser, but the second failed, it would simply apply the
rules it had. Obviously, such transitory errors are hard to account for, but other
considerations presented in this section should have been caught in the validation of
markup and style, discussed next.

Validating CSS
Like (X)HTML, it is quite possible to check your style usage against the specification.
This is also called “validation,” though the term “conformance checking” may be more
appropriate, but the intent is still clear. The W3C provides a validation service for CSS at
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. As an example, validating the page found at www
.htmlref.com/ch4/hellomalformedcssworld.html shows that it contains a number of simple
errors, as shown here:
Bad property name and value

Bad property value

Missing } to
close rule

The previous section identifies what a conformant browser should do with such errors
and, interestingly, the result is that the malformed page should appear the same as the
“well-formed page.” Like HTML, we often won’t pay a price for our mistakes until later.
The good news is that we can easily uncover these types of errors, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Notice that the service shows what is considered the resulting style sheet in light of the
encountered errors.

Validating CSS

A challenge with CSS validation is that what is valid CSS in the simple sense of rule
definition may not be valid when combined with markup or JavaScript. For example, is the
following rule in error?
<style type="text/css">
#unique {color: red; font-size: xx-large;}
</style>

Chapter 4:

449

At first blush there is nothing wrong, but it turns out the id value is used twice, as
demonstrated here:

If this document is CSS validated, everything is apparently okay:

However, with HTML validation we see that is actually not the case:

<p>I am not the unique paragraph.</p>
<p id="unique">Yet another unique paragraph?</p>
</body>
</html>

450

Part II:

Core Style

Again, visually we may get the desired effect of two large red paragraphs, but it isn’t
executed correctly and we will potentially pay a price later with JavaScript, which typically
does not allow the same latitude that presentational technologies do. Consider simply that
each layer of technology we add on with small mistakes makes the overall execution
shakier and shakier. Given this foundational approach, we should first validate markup and
then, once it is solid, validate the CSS that is layered on top.

Breaking the Rules Purposefully?
One aspect of CSS syntax that is a bit interesting is the purposeful introduction of errors into
a style sheet to effect a change. Such tricky applications of CSS are often called hacks or
filters and are simply misuses of the technology to address browser rendering concerns. To
explain clearly, let’s illustrate the idea of these techniques using probably the most famous
hack—the “box model hack.”1
What the box model hack addresses is the nasty fact that CSS implementations in older
browsers, particularly the Internet Explorer 5.X generation, is woefully broken. In the case
of such browsers, the measurements of the various large block elements that compose the
boxes of the page are fundamentally off. For example, given a rule like
#boxexample {border: 20px solid;
padding: 30px;
width:
300px;}

some browsers would correctly interpret the total width of the box defined as including the
border and padding values added to the width of the defined box, as follows:

20
px

30
px

300 px

30
px

20
px

400 px

1

The Box Model Hack was initially introduced by a well-known CSS expert, Tantek Çelik (http://tantek
.com/CSS/Examples/boxmodelhack.html), who certainly is quite aware of what to do and not to do with
CSS. The choice of this hack is only illustrative of the break the rules purposefully approach.

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

451

However, a browser that misinterprets the CSS box model, such as Internet Explorer 5,
would include the border and padding in the measurement, so it would subtract these
values to produce the rendered region:

30
px

200 px

30
px

20
px

PART II

20
px

300 px

With such a vast difference in measurement, layout variations are quite noticeable:
IE 5.5 needs fix

IE 6+ no fix needed

If you have a very old browser, try it yourself at http://htmlref.com/ch4/boxmodelhack.html.

452

Part II:

Core Style

To get around this difference, ingenious Web developers developed a technique to force
the browser parser in some cases to explode predictably. For example, given
#boxexample {border: 20px solid;
padding: 30px;
width: 300px;}

we first modify it, as shown next, to set the box width to its correct measurement of 400px
for browsers that misinterpret the calculation. Next, we add rules that these older browsers
will have problems with, thus killing the rest of the line. Finally, we add a rule for those
browsers that don’t have issues to reset the width property back to the correctly interpreted
value of 300px.
#boxexample {width: 400px;
voice-family: "\"}\"";
voice-family: inherit;
width: 300px;}

What this hack does is to act as a simple if statement, choosing one width value in one
case and a different one in another. If the solution seems messy and inappropriate to you,
know you aren’t alone. However, recognize that when faced with browser adversity, Web
developers, who are a wily group, will solve almost any problem using only the tools they
know, whether the method is appropriate or not.
You’ll certainly see more hacks and inelegant solutions as you explore the use of CSS.
The point here is not only to show that understanding the rules of CSS and browser activity
can be used purposefully, but also to illustrate the Web development truism that, while
we always aim for standards compliance, the need for hacking and addressing browser
incompatibility, just like in the old days of presentational markup, stubbornly lives on.
Regardless of this necessity, let’s move on to explore all the details of how style is applied
to markup.

Applying Style to a Document
Style information can be included in an (X)HTML document using one of three methods:
1. Use an external style sheet, either by importing it or by linking to it.
2. Directly embed a document-wide style in the head element of the document.
3. Set an inline style rule using the style attribute directly on an element.
Each of these style sheet approaches has its own pros and cons, as listed in Table 4-4.

Linking to a Style Sheet
An external style sheet is simply a plain text file containing CSS style rules. The common
file extension .css indicates that the document provides style sheet information. As an

{color: red; text-decoration: none;}
{color: red; text-decoration: underline;}
{color: red; text-decoration: none;}

Don’t worry, we haven’t covered all these properties yet, but we will certainly do so as the
book progresses. Fortunately, most of the selectors are simple element and id selectors that
have already been introduced, save the pseudo-classes, a:link, a:visited, a:hover, and
a:active, which are selectors that are associated with the various states of a link.
An (X)HTML file could use the style sheet by referencing it by using a <link> tag
within the head element of the document. To indicate the relationship between the
documents, set the rel attribute to a value of "stylesheet." The href attribute is used
to specify the URL of the style sheet to fetch. The URL may be relative or even remote,
pointing to a style sheet on some other server, though you should be cautious about
linking to remote files, given download delays and the possibility that the file could be
changed without your knowledge. The type attribute is set to indicate the type of style
sheet technology in use, as defined by the MIME type text/css. The media attribute can
be used to set how the style sheet should be applied. When omitted, the default is "all".
Later in the chapter, we will discuss how it is possible to define different styles for screen,
print, and other potential output environments. The general syntax for associating a style
using a <link> tag is shown here:
<link rel="stylesheet"
href="stylesheet URL"
type="MIME type of stylesheet"
media="media-type">

This syntax is illustrated here with a few examples:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="global.css" type="text/css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/mainscreen.css"
type="text/css" media="screen">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://htmlref.com/ch4/print.css"
type="text/css" media="print">

TIP Like other dependent files, it is advisable to put all your style sheets in a special styles directory,
usually named “styles” or “css,” available at a site root.

Chapter 4:

Of course, unless the style is bound into a document related to the defined rules, nothing
will be seen, so a full example is presented here, with a rendering shown in Figure 4-7:

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/linkedstyle.html
CSS is, at least theoretically, not the only style technology we could use, though as it
stands, by default, most browsers assume that CSS is being used. We set type to be specific
but that may get a bit redundant. The HTML specification suggests you can set a default

style sheet language in the head element of the document by using the <meta> tag, as
shown here,
<meta http-equiv="Content-Style-Type" content="text/css">

or by outputting this value in the HTTP headers delivered to a site. Interestingly, many sites
set the <meta> tag and use the type attribute, which is particularly appropriate as of this
edition’s publication as the specification dictates that the type attribute must be set and
thus the W3C validator will complain if the attribute is not set regardless of the appearance
of the <meta> tag. Check the current situation by validating the file http://htmlref.com/
ch4/metacsscheck.html using the W3 validator service. Depending on the result, you may
notice that specifications or the tools that check them aren’t always perfect.

Embedding Style Sheets
The second way to include a style sheet is to embed it. When you embed a style sheet, you
generally write the style rules directly within the document with a <style> tag found
within the head of the document. The basic syntax of the <style> tag is as follows:
<style type="text/css" media="all | print | screen" >
* style rules here *
</style>

Here, the type attribute is again used to indicate the MIME type of the enclosed style
sheet. However, this is quite often omitted because browsers generally infer CSS. The media
attribute indicates the media for which the style sheet applies. By default, the style sheet is
applied to all media, so most developers omit this attribute as well. However, as mentioned
before, it is possible to define style sheets that are applied only to a particular output
medium. The most common values are "print" and "screen, " which indicates that rules
are applied to the page only when it is printed or correspondingly shown onscreen. Other
values are possible for the media attribute but generally not supported. Within the style
block, style sheet rules are included. It is important to note that once within the <style>
tag, the rules of (X)HTML do not necessarily apply. The <style> tag defines an island of
CSS within an ocean of markup. The two technologies are intertwined, but have their
own distinct characteristics.
One concern when including style sheets within a markup document is that not all user
agents, particularly older ones or certain indexing systems like simplistic bots, may
understand style sheets. Given the possibility that the content of a style sheet is treated as
regular text, it is desirable to mask the rules. To avoid such a problem, comment out the
style information by using an (X)HTML comment, such as <!-- -->:
<style type="text/css" media="all">
<!-h1
{ color: red; font-size: 48px; }
-->
</style>

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

457

While this technique is common practice and used for script masking as well, there
are some subtle issues, particularly when including non-comment-friendly content like
multiple dashes or trying to address XML strictness. For now, here’s a complete example of
a document-wide embedded style sheet including a script mask:

#page {background-color: white;

Part II:

Core Style

You can have multiple occurrences of the style element within the head of the
document, and you can even import some styles with these elements, as discussed next.

Importing Style Sheets
Another way to use document-wide style rules rather than type the properties directly within
a <style> tag is to import them. The idea is somewhat similar to linking. An external style
sheet is still referenced, but in this case, the reference is similar to a macro or inline expansion.
The syntax for importing a style sheet is @import, followed by the keyword url and the
actual URL of the style sheet to include, and terminated with a semicolon:
@import url(corerules.css);

Though not advisable stylistically or for ensured browser compatibility, the specification
also allows us to set a string after @import of the URL, like so:
@import "corerules.css";

The @import directive must be included within a <style> tag and it must precede all
other types of rules in a style sheet. In practice, we might see an intermixture of imported
and embedded styles within a single <style> tag, as shown in this example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Imported Styles</title>
<style type="text/css" media="all">

CSS Hacks with @import

Although imported style sheets might seem to provide a great advantage for organizing
style information, they provide much the same value as a <link> element. However, CSS
developers did discover that the limited support of @import in some browsers could
be used to their advantage. For example, some very old, partially CSS-aware browsers,
particularly Netscape 4.x, did not support the @import directive properly. Because of this,
you would see page authors write rules such as this:
<style type="text/css" media="all">
<!-/* rules hidden from non-import supporting browsers */
@import url(hackingrules.css);
/* other rules here */
-->
</style>

Similar to the box-model hack discussed earlier in the chapter, this kind of rudimentary
selection statement approach, developed by understanding the likely behavior of a browser,
is really somewhat of a hack. Even worse, we see that the effect of using @import is an
annoying flashing of unstyled content in some older Internet Explorer versions. Because of
the potential problems with @import, Web page designers should consider well why they
need an outside inclusion scheme besides linked styles, until such quirks are ancient history.

Inline Styles
Instead of using a style sheet for a whole page, you can add style information directly within
a single element. Suppose you want to set one particular <h1> tag to render in extra-large,
green, Arial font. You could quickly apply the style to only the tag in question using its
style attribute, which is a core attribute common to nearly any HTML element. As an
example, the following markup shows an inline style applied to a heading:
<h1 style="font-size: xx-large; font-family: Arial; color: green;">Inline
Style!</h1>

This sort of style information doesn’t need to be hidden from a browser that isn’t style
sheet−aware, because browsers ignore any attributes that they don’t understand.

PART II

In the preceding example, we could include rules for body and div in the file corestyles.
css, whereas the rules affecting the links are included via the document linkstyles.css. We
might imagine that these rules are used in other style sheets, and thus breaking them out for
reuse via embedding or linking makes sense. Rules for h1 and p elements are placed within
the style block because they may be specific to this particular page.

460

Part II:

Core Style

Although using inline styles seems to be an easy route to using CSS, it does have a
number of drawbacks. The largest problem is that inline rules are bound very closely to a tag.
If you want to affect more than one <h1> tag, you have to copy and paste the style attribute
into every other heading of interest. The separation of markup from CSS presentation is not
optimal with an inline style. However, for quick and dirty application of CSS rules, this might
be appropriate, particularly for testing things out.
The second and lesser-known concern with inline CSS rules is that you simply cannot
perform every task with them. For example, if you want to change the look of various link
states, this is easily accomplished in a document-wide or linked style sheet with pseudo-class
rules like
a:link
a:visited
a:hover
a:active

{color: blue; text-decoration: none;}
{color: red; text-decoration: none;}
{color: red; text-decoration: underline;}
{color: red; text-decoration: none;}

However, if you attempt to put such rules in an <a> tag, how are other states indicated? The
simple example here would appear to set the color to blue for any state:
<a href="http://www.w3.org" style="color: blue;">Inline Link Styles?</a>

Similarly, in order to change the first letter of a paragraph to large, red text, you might
use a pseudo-element rule like
p:first-letter

{color: red; font-size: xx-large;}

However, when you attempt to do this inline, you are forced to introduce an element to
hold the first letter:
<p><span style="color: red; font-size: xx-large;">T</span>his is a test.</p>

While these examples indicate why these selectors were given the names pseudo-class
and pseudo-element, they don’t really show us how to use such inline styles.
It turns out that a working draft specification for addressing this issue was explored in
20022. The idea was to include style blocks without a selector for the default style and for
the various other selectors for the element, state rules directly within the style attribute.
For example, to set the link states, we would use:
<a href="http://www.w3.org/"
style="{text-decoration: none;}
:link {color: blue;}
:visited {color: red;}
:hover {color: red; text-decoration: underline;}
:active {color: red;}">Inline Link Styles?</a>

To set the first letter on paragraphs, we would use:
<p style="{text-indent: 1em;
text-align: justify;
line-height: 150%;}

:first-letter {color: red; font-size: xx-large;}">
This is a test.</p>

The emerging specification even suggested the importation of style sheets directly inline:
<div id="navbar"
style="@import url(navigationstyles.css);">just an example</div>

NOTE In numerous places in this book, inline styles will be used to demonstrate the application of

look. While it is clear this choice does not demonstrate the ideal approach to bind style to markup,
the decoupled nature of other approaches simply does not lend itself to explanations in prose.
Frequent reminders will be given to encourage you to more loosely couple style and markup once
you understand the property or tag in question.

Media Types
A significant goal of CSS2 was to add support for other output media forms beyond the
computer screen. The CSS 2.1 specification defines numerous media types, listed in Table 4-5.
Today, primarily the values all, screen, and print are used, so until browser vendors or
developers of other user agents begin to support additional media types, these definitions
have no meaning outside of the specification.

TABLE 4-5 Media Types Defined Under CSS2.1

PART II

While all these ideas are quite interesting, more than seven years after the working draft
was authored, not a single browser supports this syntax at the time this edition is being
completed. So, besides being too closely bound to tags, understand that unless this situation
has changed by the time you read this edition, only using inline styles is going to limit your
application of some of the more useful CSS selectors.

462

Part II:

Core Style

TIP If you are curious to experiment with other media type values beyond screen and print, the

Opera browser (www.opera.com) supports a number of types beyond what more popular browsers
support.

CSS provides two main ways to define media types for style sheets. The first method
simply uses the media attribute for the <link> tag to define the media type. This attribute
enables the page designer to define one style for computer screens, one for print, and
perhaps one for handheld devices or other supported media types. For example, here we
associate three different style sheets that vary by media:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="screen.css" media="screen"
type="text/css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="smallscreen.css" media="handheld"
type="text/css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print"
type="text/css">

Multiple values also can be set for the attribute. These should be separated by commas,
to show that the style can apply to many media forms; for example:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="screen.css" media="screen, projection, tv"
type="text/css">

The default value for media is all and is applied if the attribute is not used.
When using an embedded style sheet, the media attribute is used in a similar way:
<style type="text/css" media="screen, projection, tv">
/* screen rules */
</style>
<style type="text/css" media="print">
/* print rules */
</style>

When styles are imported, the @import rule can also be used with a media type by
adding the appropriate media type after defining the URL, as shown in this code
fragment:
@import url("screen.css") screen;
@import url("print.css") print;

A @media rule is used to define style rules for multiple media types in a single
embedded style sheet:
<style type="text/css">
@media screen { /* screen rules */ }
@media print { /* print rules */ }
@media screen, print { /* screen and print rules */ }
</style>

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

The syntax may look a little odd because you have to wrap style blocks with more curly
braces, like so:
<style type="text/css">
@media screen {body
{font-family: sans-serif;
font-size: 14px;}
}

Similar to limitations of inline styles for supporting pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements,
it is not possible at the time of this edition’s writing to build equivalent media-specific syntax
into a value present in an element’s core style attribute. However, given the previous
discussion of possible changes to inline styles, it seems likely that syntax like
<p style="@media print {line-height: 100%; font-size: 10px;}
@media screen {line-height: 150%;}">
This is a test.</p>

might someday be supported in a browser. However, this is purely speculation on the
author’s part, and the example and discussion here should be yet more indication that
inline styles have their limitations.

NOTE One exciting emerging use of media attributes and @media directives is the use of queries
to apply different looks depending on device characteristics. See the Chapter 6 section “Media
Queries” for more information.

Printer-Specific CSS
Currently, the main use of media-specific style sheets is to specify one style sheet for
printing and one for viewing onscreen, as demonstrated here:

PART II

@media print {body
{font-family: serif;
font-size: 10px;}
}
</style>

464

Part II:

Core Style

All modern browsers support printer styles, which would seem to suggest that the
practice of inserting a special “print format” button is obsolete. However, the sense of
“what you see is what you get” is important to users, so it is a good idea usability-wise to
allow the user to easily preview the printed page.
A printer style sheet may be used to format content quite differently. Commonly, certain
browser-specific features like navigation elements may be removed, usually accomplished
using the display property. URLs may be written out next to embedded links. For printer
styles, font sizes and layout may be changed to more appropriately fit paper consumption
which may include resorting to completely different measurement units than what is used
onscreen.

Alternative Styles
The opportunity to have different looks for different situations is an aspect often mentioned
about CSS but rarely seen. The easiest way to illustrate this is through alternative style
sheets. In a number of browsers, it is possible to then change the look of a page by selecting
an alternative style. To insert different styles, use a <link> tag and set the rel attribute
equal to “alternate stylesheet.” You will also need to set the title attribute for the tag so
that the browser can present a choice for the user. Three examples are shown here:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="standard.css" title="standard">
<link rel="alternate stylesheet" href="orange.css" title="Happy Halloween">
<link rel="alternate stylesheet" href="greenandred.css" title="Merry
Christmas">

A browser that supports the selection of alternative style sheets would then present the
possibility of choosing a different look to the user, as shown under the menu selection here:

FIGURE 4-8

Drastic look changes per style sheet

The looks created with alternative style sheets might be radically different, as shown in
Figure 4-8.

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/alternatestyles.html
Probably the most significant challenge with alternative style sheets is simply making
users aware that such choices exist. In practice, sites that allow for such customization
usually employ some JavaScript-based style picker system to make it clear customizations
can be employed:

466

Part II:

Core Style

User Styles
Users may opt to use their own style sheets when viewing a Web page. Most often, this is
done to create a look that is easier for the user to read. Under Internet Explorer, users set
their own style using the Accessibility features under Internet Options:

In some cases, setting user styles might require a browser add-on or editing of some
preference file. However, in the case of very accessibility-oriented browsers like Opera,
rapidly switching between user styles is easily performed.

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

467

User styles can be applied to arbitrary sites to improve or modify the viewing experience.
User style sheets directly expose the tension between what the site designer wants to deliver
and what the end user actually ends up viewing.

PART II

Many Web designers, however, are not comfortable with this shared control and may
attempt to use fixed sizes and fixed positions, resort to !important, or even implement
other technological overrides using Flash or images. Forcing appearance is not in the best
interest of usability. For example, if you can force a particular layout or font size, what
happens to the user with poor eyesight who really needs to adjust things in order to read the
content? The Web is not print, and forcing inflexible designs on end users will not always be
met with success.

468

Part II:

Core Style

Document Structure and CSS Inheritance
As discussed in Chapter 1, (X)HTML documents have an implicit structure. The structure of
the document is generally presented as a tree, as you have seen in a number of the examples
in this chapter. For example, the document shown here would have a tree structure like the
one shown in Figure 4-9:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Test File</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Test</h1>
<p>This is a <strong>Test</strong>!</p>
</body>
</html>

In the example parse tree, note how the <strong> tag is a child of the <p> tag, which is
in the <body>, which is in the <html> tag. What happens if you set a style rule to p
elements, as follows?
p {color: red;}

doctype
html
head
meta
title

body
h1
p
strong

FIGURE 4-9

Simple document parse tree

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

469

Would the contents of the <strong> tag enclosed in the <p> tag also be red? The answer is
yes, because the color is inherited from the parent element:
p {color:red;}
body
h1
p

Red
Red

Whereas most elements can inherit the style features of their parents, some style properties
do not inherit. For example, consider setting the border property of the paragraph like so:
p {border: solid;}

If the enclosed <strong> tag from the previous example inherited the border, you would
expect to see something like this:

This is a test
However, this does not happen; the border is limited just to the paragraph itself because the

border value is not inherited. The reference in Chapter 5 will point out important non-

inheriting properties.
Assuming that a property does inherit, it is still possible to override the inheritance of
a property. For example, consider the following two rules:
p
{color: red; font-size: xx-large;}
strong
{color: yellow;}

In this case, the color of the text within the <strong> tag would be yellow and have an xxlarge size. Both of the properties were inherited, but the color property was overridden
by the color rule for the <strong> tag, which is more specific:
p {color:red; font-size: xx-large}
strong {color: yellow;}
body
p
strong

Red, xx-large
Override
Inherit
Yellow, xx-large

PART II

strong

470

Part II:

Core Style

The combination of multiple rules, with elements inheriting some properties and
overriding others, is the idea of the cascade that CSS is named for. The general idea of the
cascade, in effect, is that it provides a system to sort out which rules apply to a document
that has many style sheets. For example, a rule for a specific <p> tag marked with an id
attribute is more powerful than a class rule applied to <p>, which in turn is more powerful
than a rule for the p element itself. Inline styles set with a style attribute are more important
than a document-wide style or linked style. An easy way to think about which rule wins is to
follow these helpful rules of thumb:
• The more specific the rule the more powerful.
• The closer the rule is to the tag the more powerful.
So with these rules, we see that id rules are more specific than class rules and thus
will override them. Inline styles are closer to tags than document-wide or external style
rules and thus take precedence, and so on.

TIP There is an actual process to determine the specificity of a particular rule versus another by

assigning numeric values to each rule, but if a designer requires such a careful analysis of the
style rules to determine an end result, the style sheet is simply too complex.

!important Override
If a particular rule should never be overridden by another rule, the !important indication
should be used. For a rule never to be ignored, insert the indication !important just before
the semicolon of the rule. For example, to always set all paragraphs to red text, you might
use the following:
p {color: red !important; font-size: 12px;}

Later on, you might have a paragraph with an inline style such as this:
<p style="color: green; font-size: 24px;">This is a test</p>

In this paragraph, the text would still be red due to the inclusion of the !important
indicator, although it would be larger because that rule was overridden as expected. When
using the !important indicator, always make sure to put it at the end of a rule; otherwise,
it will be ignored. Using the !important override is not encouraged but it is an easy way to
force a style and can be useful if finding the originating source of a value is difficult.
Now that we have discussed the general sense of rules being applied to a document
tree, let’s discuss the selectors that bind particular CSS rules to sections of a document.

Selectors
To understand CSS rules, you must first master selectors. We have briefly introduced basic
selectors such as element values and will review those first, but don’t move on too quickly,
because there are many more selectors to discuss.

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

471

Element Selectors
As shown in the previous sections, the simplest rules can be applied to all occurrences of a
particular tag, such as <p>. These selectors are called element selectors and are simply used
as follows:
element-name { /* properties */ }

As an example, to set the line spacing for all paragraphs, use a rule such as the following:
p

{line-height: 150%;}

*

{margin: 0;}

To set a value for more than one but fewer than all elements, we can group elements by
separating them with a comma. For example, if you want the tags <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> to
have the same basic background and color, you could apply the following rule:
h1, h2, h3

{background-color: yellow; color: black;}

If it turns out that each particular heading should have a different custom size, you can
then add that characteristic by adding other rules:
h1
h2
h3

{font-size: 200%;}
{font-size: 150%;}
{font-size: 125%;}

The result, as we’ll see later, is to combine all the rules to form the final rendered style.
Although associating all elements with a certain look is useful, very often designers want
to create very specific rules that are applied only to certain elements in a document or that
can be combined to form more complex rules.

id Selectors
By applying an id rule, a style can be applied to just a single tag. For example, if we name a
tag with a unique id attribute as follows
<tag id="id-value">Affected Text</tag>

we can then reference it with a CSS selector #id-value. For example,
<h1 id="FirstHeading">This is the First Heading!</h1>

can be styled with
#FirstHeading {background-color: green;}

and this would apply a green background to the element that has its id attribute set to
FirstHeading.

PART II

To set a value for all elements, the wildcard selector * (asterisk) can be used. For example,
to remove the margins on all elements, use

472

Part II:

Core Style

The following markup shows how a green background is applied to the <p> tag with
the id value of "p2", whereas no style is applied to the other paragraphs:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Id Selector Example</title>
<style type="text/css" media="all">
#p2 {background-color: green;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p id="p2">This is the second paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the third paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/idselector.html
As a core (or global) attribute, the id attribute is common to nearly all (X)HTML
elements. However, given widespread use of id attributes, page authors need to be very
careful to ensure that elements are named uniquely. Developers must not name two
elements the same name using the id attribute. If two of the paragraphs have id="p2",
what will happen? In the case of most browsers, both paragraphs will show up green.
However, this is such sloppy style that it generally will result in significant errors once
scripting is added to the document. Furthermore, the document will not validate with such
mistakes. If multiple elements should be affected in a similar way, use a class rule instead.

Element-Specific id Rules

One nonintuitive variation of an id selector is an element-specific selector like
p#p2 {background-color: green;}

This would select only paragraph elements with their id attribute set to "p2." Compare this
to a rule like
#p2 {background-color: green;}

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

473

which would match any element with an id of "p2." Immediately, you should think that
this implies that more than one element can share id values—why else would we need to
be more specific than a simple id rule? Well, within a single document, that is correct, and it
is not appropriate to have markup like
<p id="p2">I am a correctly identified paragraph</p>
<div id="p2">Wait you already used that id value!</div>
<p>Not <span id="p2">again!!!!</span> You already used the value p2!</p>

and then use style rules like

However, such rules would make sense if this were a linked style sheet used site-wide
and we had different elements in different documents all named "p2." The author considers
such usage bad style as it assumes that page content is always found within the same
document and will never move, which is not always the case. A site-wide unique id
approach would solve such future problems and would alleviate the need for this type of
selector.

class Rules
The class attribute is used to define the name(s) of the class(es) to which a particular tag
belongs. Unlike id values, class values don’t have to be unique because many elements
can be members of the same class. In fact, elements don’t even have to be of the same type
to be in a common class. Writing rules for classes is easy: simply specify the class name of
your own choosing, such as “nature,” with a period before it as the selector:
.nature {color: green;}

The use of class is illustrated here:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Class Selector Example</title>
<style type="text/css" media="all">
.veryimportant {background-color: yellow;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="veryimportant">Example</h1>
<p class="veryimportant">This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
<p class="veryimportant">This is the third paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

PART II

div#p2 {background-color: blue; color: white;}
span#p2 {color: blue;}

474

Part II:

Core Style

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/classselector.html
The previous example has three elements, each of which has its class attribute set to
“veryimportant.” According to the style sheet information, all members of the “veryimportant”
class have a yellow background color:

Other variations on class rules are possible. For example, setting all h1 elements of the
class “veryimportant” to have a background color of orange could be written like this:
h1.veryimportant {background-color: orange;}

In some ways, you can think of a class rule with a wildcard selector like
*.veryimportant {background-color: orange;}

as being the same as the commonly used class selector
.veryimportant {background-color: orange;}

While this is syntactically correct, it doesn’t add much understanding. More interesting and
quite underused is the possibility in selectors to combine classes together directly. For
example, consider the following rule:
h1.veryimportant.stuff {background-color: green;}

This would match only <h1> tags with class attribute values including “veryimportant”
and “stuff.” Given these rules, the following tags with class attributes would be affected in
the various ways indicated:
<h1 class="veryimportant">Has an orange background</h1>
<h1 class="veryimportant dummy">Has an orange background</h1>
<h1 class="veryimportant stuff">Has a green background</h1>
<h1 class="veryimportant dummy stuff">Has a green background</h1>
<h1 class="dummy">Default background unless class rule for dummy set</h1>

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

475

Notice that the rule for green background matches any <h1> tag that includes the class
values “veryimportant” and “stuff” but not necessarily uniquely or in order. If you are
looking to write a rule that matches any single occurrence of a particular group of class
values, then the comma operator is in order. For example, separating the following three
class names by commas
.larry,

.curly,

.moe

{color: red;}

would mean that any element with a single occurrence or more of these class values would
be set as red.
The following is a complete example showing multiple class rules working together:

<h1 class="veryimportant heading stuff">Heading (yellow background, red
text, italic, and Impact)</h1>
<p class="veryimportant">This is the first paragraph. (yellow background,
black text)</p>
<p class="stuff">This is the second paragraph. (red text, default
background)</p>
<p class="veryimportant stuff">This is the third paragraph.
(yellow background, red text, italic)</p>
<p class="stuff veryimportant example dummy">This is the fourth paragraph.
(yellow background, red text, italic, underlined)</p>
</body>

Part II:

Core Style

As these examples have shown, classes can be used to significantly reduce the number
of style rules necessary in a document.

Contextual Selection
Although the class and id attributes provide a great deal of flexibility for creating style
rules, many other types of rules of equal value exist. For example, it might be useful to specify
that all <strong> tags that occur within a <p> tag get treated in a certain way, as compared to
the same elements occurring elsewhere within the document. To create such a rule, you must
use contextual selection. Contextual selectors are created by showing the order in which the
tags must be nested for the rule to be applied. The nesting order is indicated by a space
between each selector. For example, given the rule
p strong {background-color: yellow;}

all occurrences of the strong element within a p element have a yellow background. Other
occurrences of strong without a p ancestor element might not necessarily have the yellow
background.

TIP Be careful about the use of the space and comma in CSS selectors; it is easy to turn grouping
into contextual selection or vice versa with a simple typo.

Contextual selection does not require a direct parent-child relationship with elements.
For example, with the rule in the preceding example, you would find that given
<p>This <span>is not <strong>directly</strong>within</span>
the paragraph.</p>

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

477

the nested <strong> tag will still have a yellow background even though it is not directly
within the <p> tag. What you are seeing here is that the rule really says that all <strong>
tags that are “descendents” of a <p> tag are given a yellow background:
p strong {background-color: yellow;}
body

Not Yellow
Not Descendent of P

div

body

PART II

strong

Yellow
Direct Descendent
p
strong

Yellow
Indirect descendent

body
p
span
strong

Descendent selection is not limited to a single level, nor does it require just generic
element selection; for example, here we say that links inside of unordered lists found inside
of the div element with the id of “nav” should have no underlines:
div#nav ul a {text-decoration: none;}

It is also possible that using a wildcard selector may be useful with contextual selection.
The rule
body * a {text-decoration: none;}

would select only <a> tags that are descendents of some tag found under the body element.
While using multiple elements together can be quite powerful, more specific selections
require other CSS selector syntax.

478

Part II:

Core Style

Direct Descendent Selector

CSS2 introduced the child selector specified by the greater than symbol (>) to form a rule
to match only elements that are directly enclosed within another element. Consider the
following rule:
body > p

{background-color: yellow;}

Here we find that only paragraphs that are the direct children of the body element have a
yellow background:
<body>
<p>I have a yellow background</p>
<div><p>I do not have a yellow background.</p></div>
</body>
p strong {background-color: yellow;}
body
Yellow - Direct Descendent

p
div
p

Not Yellow - Not Direct Descendent

Adjacent Sibling Selectors

A similar rule called the adjacent-sibling selector is specified using the plus sign (+) and is
used to select elements that would be siblings of each other. For example, consider the
following rule:
h1 + p {color: red;}

This states that all paragraph elements that are directly after an <h1> are red, as indicated
by this markup:
<h1>I am a heading</h1>
<p>I am an adjacent paragraph so I am red!</p>
<p>I am not adjacent so I am not red.</p>
h1 + p {color: red;}
body
h1
p

Red - Adjacent to h1

p

Not Red - Not Adjacent to h1

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

479

General Sibling Selectors

A CSS3 selector (~) can be used to select elements that happen to have a particular element
preceding them as a sibling directly. For example,
h1 ~ p {color: red;}

would mean that <p> tags that eventually follow at the same tag nesting level as <h1> tags
would be red:

h1 ~ p {color: red;}
body
p

Not Red

h1
p

Red

h2
Red

p
div
p

Not Red

NOTE Advanced contextual selectors like direct child selectors are not supported under some
relatively recent Internet Explorer versions, notably IE 6 and earlier.

A summary of all the core element selectors discussed so far can be found in Table 4-6.

Attribute Selectors
Attribute selectors, first introduced in CSS2, allow rules to match elements with particular
attributes or attribute values. For example, a rule such as
a[href] {background-color: yellow;}

would match all <a> tags that simply have the href attribute, whereas a rule such as
a[href="http://www.htmlref.com"] {font-weight: bold;}

would match only those <a> tags that have an href value set to the book’s support site URL.

PART II

<p>I am not red.</p>
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>This is red.</p>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<p>I am red too.</p>

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

481

It is possible to match multiple attribute values or even pieces of the attribute values.
For example, to match a value in a space-separated list, you might use a rule like this:
p[title~="Larry"] {font-style: italic;}

This rule would match
<p title="Larry Curly and Moe">This is italic.</p>
<p title="Larry">This is italic.</p>
<p title="Larry-The-Stooge">This is not italic.</p>

p[lang|="en"] {color: red;} /* English text in red */

This rule would then affect English paragraphs but not paragraphs that have no language
specified or a different value than an English variation:
<p lang="en">This is English and red.</p>
<p lang="en-uk">This is British English and red.</p>
<p>Not red no lang specified.</p>
<p lang="fr">C'est Francais. (Not red)</p>

Later we will see an alternate form of language selection using a CSS3 pseudo-class
called :lang(). We’ll save that for later when we discuss other pseudo-classes, but while
we’re on the topic of CSS3, let’s see what attribute selection possibilities this emerging
specification introduces.

CSS3 Attribute Selectors

CSS3 introduces a number of new attribute selectors. For example, you can now match
attributes that start with a particular value using [attr^=value]. Here we match
paragraphs that have title attributes that start with “Start match”
p [title^="Start match"]

{background-color: red;}

and apply them to the following markup:
<p title="Start match">This should be red.</p>
<p title="No Start Match">This should not be red.</p>

Using [attr$=value], we can match the end of an attribute value. For example, here
we match paragraphs with title attributes that end with “match end”
p.group4[title$="match end"] {background-color: red;}

which is demonstrated with this markup:
<p class="group4" title="This should match end">This should be red.</p>
<p class="group4" title="This won't match end!">This shouldn't be red.</p>

PART II

To match an attribute value separated by dashes, which is common in language values
(for example, en-uk, en-us, and so on), use a rule like this:

482

Part II:

Core Style

Finally, we can look over an attribute value and find matches within it using

[attr*=value]. Here we match paragraph elements with the word “found” present in the
title attribute:
p [title*="found"]

{background-color: red;}

This will match
<p title="The match is found in here">This should be red.</p>

but not match this paragraph
<p title="No match can be seen here">This shouldn't be red.</p>

as it is missing the word we match on. However, note that this isn’t really a word match but
more a substring match as it will match the following markup:
<p class="group4" title="*foundinside*">This should be red.</p>

However, as a pattern match, it is susceptible to casing, so this markup
<p class="group4" title="*Foundinside*">This shouldn't be red.</p>

wouldn’t match. If you are familiar with regular expressions and start to imagine a complex
CSS selector system with case-sensitivity wildcards and more. If you have bad dreams
about regular expressions, you might guess where this trend may end up someday.

Multiple Attribute Selectors

As you learn about more selectors, always remember that you can combine previous ideas
together. For example,
p.group1[title] {background-color: red;}

would match any <p> tag with the class “group1” and with the title attribute set.
Contextual selection also could be applied, where
#nav a[href="http://"] {font-weight: bold;}

would match any <a> tags which are descendents of some element with an id value of
“nav” that have href values that start with “http://” and make them bold.
We can also match multiple attribute characteristics at once. Consider the following:
p[title="Test Selector"][lang|="en"] {border: 2px solid black; }

This rule would match a <p> tag with a title set to “Test Selector” and a lang value in the
English family. To experiment with attribute selectors, see the example online at http://
htmlref.com/ch4/attributeselectors.html. Table 4-7 presents all the attribute selectors
together.

Pseudo-Element Selectors
You may encounter situations in which you want to select a particular portion of an HTML
document but there is not a defined element associated with it. CSS provides the ability to
style portions of a document tree without a unique element associated with the content.
Because in some ways this creates an element to effect this change, such selectors are
dubbed pseudo-element selectors.

:first-letter and :first-line Pseudo-Elements

To style the first line of a paragraph or a first character of a paragraph, it would be easy
enough to specify a CSS selector. However, we might not actually have a full element that
the rule is bound to, so a pseudo-element is thus implied. As an example, say you want to
make the first character of a paragraph called “intro” large, you can use a pseudo-element
rule :first-letter to bind style.
p:first-letter {font-size: xx-large; background-color: red;}

would make every first letter of a paragraph large and red. We can also make the initial line
of paragraphs a different style using the :first-line pseudo-element:
p:first-line {font-size: xx-large; text-decoration: underline;}

These pseudo-classes aren’t limited solely to <p> tags but they are generally limited to block
elements. A simple example of applying these pseudo-elements is shown here:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>First Letter and First Line Pseudo-Elements</title>
<style type="text/css" media="all">
p#intro:first-letter {font-size: 5em; font-weight: bold;
float: left; margin-right: .1em;
color: #999;}
p#intro:first-line {font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p id="intro">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of
belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was
the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of
despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all
going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short,
the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest
authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the
superlative degree of comparison only.</p>

This would style the first line of some classic prose with an initial drop cap and varied first
line, as shown in the following illustration.

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/firstletterandline.html

PART II

NOTE Under CSS3, the syntax of pseudo-elements has been changed to have two colons, so

:first-line becomes ::first-line. This change makes the difference between a

pseudo-element and a pseudo-class explicit, but since this syntax is not as widely supported
yet, the examples will focus on the traditional CSS2 syntax, which will likely continue to be
supported for quite some time.

:before and :after Pseudo-Elements

A very useful pair of pseudo-elements are the :before and :after selectors, which under
CSS3 are written as ::before and ::after. These selectors are used to add generated
content before or after an element and nearly always are combined with the CSS2 property
content, which is used to insert dynamically generated content. As an example, we might
use these selectors to insert special start- and end-of-section indicator images. Consider the
following:
div.section:before {content: url(sectionstart.gif);}
div.section:after {content: url(sectionend.gif);}

The content property can be used to specify objects like images, as indicated by the
preceding example, but it also can specify regular text content; for example,
p.warn:before {content: "Warning!";}

will print the word “Warning!” before every paragraph in class “warn.” The following
example uses :before and :after pseudo-elements, a rendering of which appears in

::selection Pseudo-Element

CSS3 introduces a pseudo-element ::selection that is used to style parts of an element
that is currently selected or, as more commonly thought of, highlighted. The following
simple example demonstrates this pseudo-element:

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/selection.html

NOTE Because of browser support with more emerging features, you may see CSS stem syntax; in
this case, –moz-selection is employed to improve the likelihood of rendering.

Table 4-8 summarizes all the pseudo-elements available in CSS1 through CSS3.

Pseudo-Class Selectors
Like pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes allow CSS selectors to specify styles for multiple
sections of a document tree that may not have style groups clearly associated with them.
Traditionally, pseudo-classes were dominantly used with link states and simple interface
states, but under CSS2 and CSS3, the number of pseudo-classes has exploded to include a
wide variety of document position and tree logic selectors. No doubt by the time you read
this there will be even more!

Link-Related Pseudo-Classes

Even if you have just a passing familiarity with using a Web site, you’ll note that there are
three primary states to typical text links—unvisited, visited, and active (mid-press)—in
which the link text color is blue, purple, and red, respectively. In CSS, the presentation of link
states is controlled through the pseudo-class selectors a:link, a:visited, and a:active.
CSS2 also adds a:hover for the mouse hovering over a link, though this pseudo-class in
theory isn’t limited to links. Similarly, the pseudo-class :focus would be selected when the
link gains focus—generally through keyboard navigation. An example demonstrating how
these link-related pseudo-class selectors are used is shown here:

a:link
a:active
a:visited
a:hover
a:focus

{color: blue; text-decoration: none;}
{color: red; background-color: #FFC;}
{color: purple; text-decoration: none;}
{color: red; text-decoration: underline;}
{border-style: dashed; border-width: 1px;
background-color: #FFA500;}

</style>
</head>
<body>
<a href="http://www.htmlref.com">HTML: The Complete Reference</a>
</body>
</html>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/linkstates.html
Although the CSS rules associated with the states of a link can be used to change the link’s
appearance in dramatic ways, designers are encouraged to limit changes to improve usability.
Also note that size changes and other significant differences in link presentation can result in
undesirable screen refreshes as the document reloads. For example, with a rule such as
a:hover {font-size: larger;}

you may notice text lines shifting up and down as you roll over links.
A newer link-related pseudo-class is :target, which is used to style an element when it
is a link target and the current URL of the document has that fragment identifier in its URL.
For example, given the rule
#top:target {background-color: green;}

a tag like
<span id="top">I am the top of the document.</span>

would get a green background color only when the current URL includes the fragment
identifier #top.

Try the example online if you are still unsure of how the element works.

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/target.html
Activity Related Pseudo-Classes—:hover and :focus

There are other pseudo-classes related to user activity, most notably :hover and :focus.
The :focus pseudo-class is used to apply a rule to an element only when that element has
focus. Typically, form fields can accept keyboard input and thus can gain focus. So to set
any text input field to have a yellow background color when it gains focus, you would use a
rule such as the following:
input[type=text]:focus {background-color: yellow;}

The :hover pseudo-class, as discussed in the previous section, is used primarily to change
the appearance of links when the user’s pointer is hovering over them:
a {text-decoration: none;}
a:hover {text-decoration: underline;}

However, it is possible to apply this pseudo-class to just about any element, so a rule such as
p:hover {background-color: yellow;}

is perfectly valid, although it produces a potentially annoying effect and not everybody’s
browser has support for this selector on all elements.
The following is a simple example demonstrating these pseudo-class selectors:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Hover and Focus Pseudo-Class Example</title>
<style type="text/css" media="screen">
.annoy:hover
{border-style: dashed; background-color: yellow;}
input[type=text]:hover
{background-color: yellow; }
input[type=text]:focus
{background-color: #FFA500;}
</style>
</head>

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

491

<body>
<p class="annoy">Roll over me.</p>
<p>Now <span class="annoy">roll over</span> that bit of text.</p>
<form action="#">
<div><input type="text" size="40" value="Hover and then click into this
field"></div>
</form>
</body>
</html>

Interface State Pseudo-Classes

User interface elements such as forms have various states depending on user activity. CSS3
introduces pseudo-classes to style form elements depending on state. For example,
:enabled and :disabled are used to specify the style for elements that have been enabled
or disabled, respectively, generally by whether the (X)HTML attribute disabled has been
set. For example, the rule
input[type=text]:enabled {background-color: yellow;}

would apply a yellow background to the text field here
<input type="text" size="40" value="This field is enabled"><br>

while this rule
input[type=text]:disabled {background-color: red;}

would apply to a red background to a disabled field like
<input type="text" disabled size="40" value="This field is disabled">

It should be noted that very often the disabling or enabling of fields will not be directly
present in markup, but may be set by JavaScript.
The style of check boxes and radio buttons can be controlled using the :checked
pseudo-property. For example,
input[type=checkbox]:checked {border: 2px solid red;}

would put a special border on the check box once it was set.
Other user-interface selectors are also defined under an emerging CSS3 UI specification,3
like :default, :valid, :invalid, :in-range, :out-of-range, :required, :optional,
:read-only, and :read-write. The meaning of some of these should be clear; for example,
input[type=text]:readonly {border: 2px dashed red;}

PART II

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/hoverfocus.html

492

Part II:

Core Style

would set any text field that has a readonly attribute set to have a dashed red border. If we
wanted to select fields that were both readable and writable, we would use a rule like
input[type=text]:read-write {border: 2px dashed red;}

which would pick all text fields that are not read-only.
If we have a set of various input elements where one is the default, we could use the
:default pseudo-class rule to style it. For example,
input[type=submit]:default {background-color: red;}

would set the default submit button in a form to have a red background.
Looking further, the meaning of the emerging pseudo-classes becomes less clear. While
it seems obvious reading the specification that :valid and :invalid could be used to style
interface elements which are not in a valid state, a pseudo-class of :required would pick
fields which are required state and so on. However, even if the selectors are clear, the big
question is how do you actually indicate such states for markup elements? The specification
defines that this is related to WebForms, which is not a well-implemented technology.
However, many of the useful ideas of that specification have made their way into HTML5,
so it is quite possible these selectors will someday be implemented. Certainly support for
these selectors should not be assumed, so please test the example online.

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/elementstate.html
Document Tree Pseudo-Classes

CSS2 supports a pseudo-class :first-child that is used to find only the first child of a
parent element. For example,
ul li:first-child {font-weight: bold;}

would make the first <li> tag found within an unordered list tag (<ul>) bold. Do note that
without using descendent selectors, you are specifying a universal selector. For example, a
rule like
p:first-child {color: red;}

really is
*

p:first-child {color: red;}

because it says that any time a <p> tag is a first child of some element including the body
element it would be red. Try for yourself, using this simple example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>First Child Pseudo-Class</title>
<style type="text/css" media="screen">
p:first-child { color: red;}
</style>
</head>

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

493

<body>
<p>I should be red because I am the first child in the body.</p>
<p>I should not be red because I am the second child in the body.</p>
<div>
<p>I should be red because I am the first child of div.</p>
<p>Second child of div, thus not red.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/firstchild.html

ul li:last-child {background-color: black; color: white;}

would make the last list item in an unordered list have white text on a black background.
You are not limited to looking just at the first or last child of an element. You can also
look at the :nth-child(). For example,
ul li:nth-child(5) {font-size: xx-large;}

would make the fifth list item very large if the list had a fifth item. Of course, such syntax
means that :nth-child(1) is the same as :first-child, which is of course much more
readable.
The :nth-child() selector is quite powerful because you can use simple keywords like
odd and even to alternate every other child. For example,
ul li:nth-child(odd) {color: red;}
ul li:nth-child(even) {color: blue;}

would make all odd children in a list red and all even ones blue.
Now suppose you want to make every third element in this unordered list italic; you
could use a rule like
ul li:nth-child(3n) {font-style: italic;}

We can also perform these actions from the end of a tree to look for the last child of a
particular element. For example,
ul li:nth-last-child(2) {text-decoration: underline;}

would make the second-to-last item in the list underlined. Given this syntax, :nth-lastchild(1) is the same as :last-child, which is obviously preferable. We can use all the
same keywords and counting values in the :nth-last-child() pseudo-class as we did in
:nth-child().
We can also look for elements of particular types within a subtree. For example,
p span:first-of-type {color: red;}
p span:last-of-type {color: green;}

PART II

CSS3 introduces a multitude of document tree–related pseudo-classes. To complement
:first-child(), we now have :last-child(), so

494

Part II:

Core Style

would set the first <span> tag found in the paragraph to red and the last <span> tag found
to green. Of course, those might be one and the same, which would then make the item
green since that was the final rule defined and applied.
It is also possible to find particular items of a type. For example, this makes the third
<span> tag encountered in a paragraph larger,
p span:nth-of-type(3) {font-size: larger;}

while this makes the second-to-last <span> tag underlined:
p span:nth-last-of-type(2) {text-decoration: underline;}

The value of these rules as opposed to children is clear when there are other elements
found in a subtree or when you start combining rules. For example,
p#intro .fancy:nth-of-type(4n) {color: red;}

would make every fourth element in class “fancy” found within the paragraph called
“intro” red. As you see, we can get quite specific with CSS3 tree pseudo-class selectors.
If we are looking for uniqueness, we have two pseudo-classes of interest, :only-child
and :only-of-type. For example, this rule would make a span green when it is the only
child found in a paragraph:
p span:only-child {color: green;}

so
<p>I am the <span>only child so I am green</span>.</p>
<p>I have <span>two</span> <em>children</em> so no green here.</p>

If we care to look for subtrees that contain elements, only a certain type use

:only-of-type. For example,

p em:only-of-type {background-color: red;}

would set the <em> tag to have a red background if it was the only one found in a
paragraph, as demonstrated by this markup:
<p>I have a single <em>em so I am red</em>.</p>
<p>I have <em>two</em> <em>em</em> tags so neither is red.</p>

If all these different tree selectors are making your head hurt, we will finish off with
some easy ones. First is the :root pseudo-class, which in the case of (X)HTML is always
going to be the html element, so
:root {color: red;}

makes all tags red. The value of this selector is clearly for XML where the definition of the
root element in a language is variable as opposed to (X)HTML where it is always <html>.
Second is the :empty selector, which can be used to select elements that are empty (in other
words, have no children). So this rule would find all the <p> tags that are empty and show
them with a solid red border:
p:empty {border: 2px solid red;}

Language Pseudo-Class :lang

Attribute selectors are often used to address values set for the common lang attribute
because designers very often need to set rules to quickly pick out one language or another
in a document. The :lang() pseudo-class performs the same thing as the |= selector.
Instead of writing
p[lang|="en"] { color: red; } /* English text in red */

we can write using a pseudo-class selector:
p:lang(en) { color: red; } /* English text in red */

<p lang="en">This is English and red.</p>
<p lang="en-uk">This is British English and red.</p>
<p>Not red no lang specified.</p>
<p lang="fr">C'est Francais. (Not red)</p>

Specification-wise, the pseudo-class approach is preferred, but for best support, you
might find that the older syntax is more widely implemented.

Negation Pseudo-Class :not

One of the most interesting pseudo-classes introduced by CSS3 is :not(), which is used to
reverse logic. For example,
p:not(.plain) {color: red;}

says that all paragraph tags not in class “plain” should be colored red. The :not() selector
takes simple parameters such as element type selectors, the wildcard selector, attribute
selectors, id selectors, class selectors, and most pseudo-classes besides itself. As a more
complex example, a rule like
#nav > a:not(:hover) {color: green;}

would select all links with an element called “nav” that are not being hovered over and set
them to be green. You can test these simple examples to see if your browser conforms to this
newer selector with the example at http://htmlref.com/ch4/not.html.

TIP Negative logic can be quite confusing. Beware of adding more complexity than you need to
using the :not() pseudo-class.

Now we are finished with selectors, but more selectors are expected any day now as
CSS3 continues to grow. We summarize the last group of selectors in Table 4-9. All of the
selectors are grouped together in one large table in Chapter 5 for reference purposes.

CSS Properties Preview
Now that you’ve seen how elements are selected by rules in style sheets, you probably are
wondering what are the various properties that can be set. There are lots of things to choose
from; in fact, there are dozens of CSS1 and CSS2 properties. Roughly, we can break properties
into several groups, including font, background, positioning, borders, and more. Table 4-10
details the groups with a sampling of the various properties under each. We will cover each
of these properties in Chapter 5.

Overview of CSS1 and CSS2 Properties

CSS3, which isn’t completed, defines even more properties. Of course, the browser
vendors are busy inventing new ones all the time as well, which adds to the challenge of
documenting which emerging properties works. That task is taken up in Chapter 6.

Core Style

Given the multitude of CSS properties, there is also a multitude of values to which they
can be set. We next introduce measurements and will see their use throughout the examples
in this and the following chapters.

Measurements and Values
CSS properties support a wide variety of values, from keywords like xx-large, underline,
and solid, to a variety of absolute measurements like inches (in) and centimeters (cm), to
often poorly understood relative measurements like em units, ex values, and percentages. We
present an overview of the types of measurements and values found in CSS in Table 4-11.

Unit

Description

Examples

Absolute
Lengths

Lengths are used for horizontal or vertical
measurements. Absolute length units
supported in CSS 2.1 include inches (in),
centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), points
(pt), and picas (pc). A single point is equal
to 1/72nd of an inch and thus does not
equate to a pixel unless there are 72 pixels
per inch on screen. A pica is equal to
12 points (in other words, 1/6th of an inch).
Absolute measures should be used when
the physical characteristics of the display
medium are well understood, such as in
printing.

p {margin: 0.5in;}

There are 17 defined colors under CSS 2.1.
Each is listed here with its six-digit hex form
equivalence:

p.intro {
background-color: orange;
color: black;}

Color
Keyword

maroon (#800000) red (#ff0000)
orange (#ffA500) yellow (#ffff00)
olive (#808000)
purple (#800080)
fuchsia (#ff00ff) white (#ffffff)
lime (#00ff00) green (#008000)
navy (#000080)
blue (#0000ff)
aqua (#00ffff) teal (#008080)
black (#000000) silver (#c0c0c0)
gray (#808080)
Other color keywords may be commonly
used but are ad hoc in their definition. See
Appendix C for more information.

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

Description

Examples

3-Hex Color

This is an RGB hexadecimal format of
#rgb where r corresponds to a hex value
(0–F) for red, g for green, and b for blue.
For example, #f00 would specify pure red,
while #fff would specify white. Given its
data limits, the format is less expressive
than 6-Hex.

body {
background-color: #000;
color: #fff;}

6-Hex Color

This is an RGB hexadecimal format of
#rrggbb where rr corresponds to a hex value
(00–FF) for red, g in the same range for
green, and b for blue. For example, #ff0000
would specify pure red, while #ffffff would
specify white. More expressive than the
3-digit hex form, this can represent values
like #ffA500 (orange).

body {
background-color: #ffA500;
color: #f3ffff;}

HSL Color

CSS3 introduces Hue Saturation
Lightness (HSL), where color values are
specified as hsl(hue,saturation,
lightness). Hue is set as the degree
on the color wheel, where 0 or 360 if you
wrap around is red, 120 is green, and 240
is blue, with the various other colors found
between. Saturation is a percentage value,
with 100% being the fully saturated color.
Lightness is a percentage, with 0% being
dark and 100% light with the average 50%
being the norm.

#red {
color: hsl(0,100%, 50%);}

HSLa Color

This is the CSS3 HSL value with a fourth
value to set the alpha channel value for the
color to define the opacity of the element.
An HSLa is specified via a function style
hsla(hue,saturation,lightness,
alpha), where hue, saturation, and
lightness are the same as standard hsl()
values, and the alpha channel value for
defining opacity is a number between 0
(fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque).

#bluetrans {color:
hsla(240,100%,50%,0.5);}

RGB Color

A decimal or percentage RGB color can be
specified via a function style rgb(r,g,b)
value, where r, g, and b are specified
as a decimal value from 0 to 255 or a
percentage from 0 to 100%. Values outside
this range will be rounded up or down to fit
the closest value.

strong {
color: rgb(255,0,0);}

RGBa Color

This is like RBG color but adds an alpha
channel value to specify the opacity of the
color. An RGBa is specified via a function
style rgba(r,g,b,a) value, where colors
r, g, and b are specified as a decimal
value from 0 to 255 or a percentage from
0 to 100%, and the alpha channel value
for defining opacity is a number between
0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque).
Values outside this range will be rounded
up or down to fit the closest value.

#redtrans {
color:rgba(255,0,0,0.4);}

Keywords

There are numerous keyword values found
in CSS for specifying sizes (xx-large),
border styles (dashed), text-formatting
(underlined), element meaning (block),
layout (absolute), and more. If a value
is not found within quotes or followed
by a measurement, it is likely a keyword
or counter. If it isn’t or is simply not an
understood value, it will be ignored by CSSconforming user agents.

.big {
font-size: xx-large;}

Counters

#boom {
border: 3px crazy black;}
/* value of crazy
is ignored */
ol.cT {
counter-reset:counter1;
list-style-type: none;}
ol.cT li:before {
counter-increment:
counter1;
content:
counter(counter1) " - " ;}

Numbers

Percentages

TABLE 4-11

#box {
border: 1px solid black;}

There are occasions where CSS supports
simple positive or negative integer values
like 2 and –3 as well as real numbers like
3.5. Note that in the case of 0 values, it
is not required to put a measurement unit
like px and thus a plain zero value will be
commonly seen.

p {line-height: 2;}
/* same as 200% */

Percentages are denoted by a number
followed by the % symbol and are always
relative to another value such as a length.
Quite often they are used to specify some
value relative to an inherited value from a
parent element.

body {font-size: 10px;}
body > p.big
{font-size: 200%;}
/* 20 px */

CSS Units and Lengths

* {margin: 0;}

body > p.small
{font-size: 50%;}
/* 5px */

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

Unit

Description

Examples

Relative
Lengths

Although relative lengths are often
misunderstood, they are quite useful as
they can be used to scale layouts to handle
very different viewing situations. An em
unit is related to the font-size of a
particular font being measured. Very often,
this unit is used relative to the font-size
of its inheriting parent. An ex value is
called the x-height and is used to measure
the height of font as defined by the size
of its lowercase x character. A ch value
introduced by CSS3 is another font-related
length, which is equivalent to the width
of the character 0 (zero) in the current
font and has started to be supported in
some browsers. Surprising to some Web
developers, a pixel (px) is also a relative
unit, as there may be different pixel
densities on different screens.

p.lead {text-indent:
0.5em;}
.bigger {font-size: 3ex;}

Strings are defined with either single
quotes (‘example’) or double quotes
(“example”). Quotes may be found within
the opposite quote (“I say this is an
‘example’!”). Newlines may be specified
with a “\00000a” value. In situations
where a newline is typed, a \ character can
be used as line continuation.

p {
font-family: "Fancy Font";}

Uniform Resource Identifiers generally
limited to the commonly known Uniform
Resource Location (URL) are designated
using the function style url(address),
where address is an absolute or relative URL.

body {
background: url(stars
.png);}

URL

TABLE 4-11

#moreThanZero
{font-size: 10ch;}
#box {height: 100px;
width: 100px;}

a[title="Next\
Line here"] {color: red;}

CSS Units and Lengths (continued)

NOTE There are other values found in CSS3 such as viewport sizes (vh, vw, vm), root relative

sizing (rem), and grid measurements (gd). Aural CSS such as angles [degrees (deg), grads
(grad), and radians (rad)], times [milliseconds (ms) and seconds (s)], frequencies [Hertz (Hz)
and kilo Hertz (kHz)] are also defined. These are discussed more in the reference that follows in
the next two chapters.

However, without the context of the properties in which they are used, some of the
values may not make much sense; thus, when using them in examples and presenting
various properties in the following chapters, we will strive to use them in context.

CSS and (X)HTML Elements Fundamentals
CSS relies on markup. As mentioned a number of times already, incorrect markup is likely
going to result in incorrect style. However, the symbiotic relationship between (X)HTML
and CSS isn’t one way. It is quite possible to misuse markup due to the implications of CSS.
In this section, we explore just how dependent the two technologies are on each other,
discuss how CSS can fundamentally alter the perceived nature of markup, and encourage
Web developers to use these newfound powers for good not ill.

Physical Markup and Overriding Expected Results
One potential problem with style sheets and HTML is that the default rendering of an element
might get in the way. For example, consider the situation in which you apply a style rule to
a <strong> tag like so:
<strong style="color: red;">I am strong!</strong>

While this will put the text contents in red as expected, it will also probably be bold
because that is the typical rendering of this (X)HTML element. Designers have to consider
these default renderings as rules are added; a careless document author can create a potentially
confusing use of markup using style sheets. Here we change two tags to act the opposite of
how you might expect them to act:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Improper Overrides</title>
<style type="text/css" media="all">
b {font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;}
i {font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>I am a <b>bold tag</b> and I am an <i>italic tag</i>.</p>
</body>
</html>

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/improperoverride.html

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

507

Given the physical nature of some (X)HTML tags, it should be obvious now why some
have been deprecated and logical elements have become more useful with the rise of style
sheets. When using an <em> tag, it means simply that something is emphasized, not that it
is generally italic:
<style type="text/css" media="all">
em {font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>I am <b>emphasized</b> does it matter how? </p>

<style type="text/css" media="all">
h1 {font-size: xx-small;}
h6 {font-size: xx-large;}
</style>

shouldn’t be bad. Unfortunately, it is probably more common that the perceived meaning of
each tag implies a look which these rules seem to violate. So while it is clear that logical
elements rather than physical elements would provide more flexibility with CSS, this
choice assumes that logical element renderings are not defined or assumed too commonly
by developers. It turns out that, given such needs, the next two elements presented are
quite useful.

Are <div> and <span> the Most Popular Tags?
When using style sheets and trying to avoid the default rendering of HTML elements,
document authors will find the use of the div and span elements indispensable. The div
element and span element are block and inline elements, respectively, that have no
particular rendering. You might call them generic tags. Because these tags don’t have any
predefined meaning or rendering, they are very useful for arbitrary style duties. For
example, using a <div> tag, you can apply a style to a certain section or division of a
document very easily:
<div style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold; color: black;">
<p>Style sheets separate the structure of a document from its
presentation. Dividing layout and presentation has many
theoretical benefits and can provide for flexible documents
that display equally well on large graphically rich systems
and palmtop computers.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph describing the wonderful benefits of
style sheets</p>
</div>

PART II

In theory, setting logical tags to render any way the developer wants will not cause as
much confusion for later viewers of the markup. Of course, this assumes that readers don’t
apply predefined physical thinking to logical markup, so

508

Part II:

Core Style

However, as a block element, div should induce a return, so if you want to provide
style information solely for a few words, or even a few letters, the best approach is to use
the span element, which as an inline element does not induce a return. For example, notice
how a <span> tag is used to call attention to a particular section of text:
<p>Calling out <span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;
color: black;">special sections of text</span> isn't hard with a
span and CSS.</p>

The advantage of these generic elements is clear, but they are easily abused. For
example, instead of using elements in a meaningful way, we see excessive <div> and
<span> tags being employed. For example, here we use a heading with a class
<style type="text/css" media="all">
h1.heading {font-size: xx-large; color: red; font-style: italic;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="heading">I am a heading?</h1>

but a designer might resort to using a <div> tag instead,
<style type="text/css" media="all">
.heading {font-size: xx-large; color: red; font-style: italic;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="heading">I am a heading?</div>

which removes any meaning that may have been gained from the <h1> tag. Regardless of
the specific likelihood of the example, what we see is that developers often employ way too
many <div> and <span> tags and then apply class values to associate meaning and style
with them. We note that this is reaching epidemic proportions with some CSS designers,
leading some to dub this a Web “malady” called “div-itis” or “class-itis.” The basic problem
is that developers forgo older HTML-focused methods like tables and trumpet tableless and
CSS-focused design, only to introduce tremendous problems of their own. A technology
will encourage good practices, but it is easy to miss the intent and go off the deep end.
A well-done CSS document looks like a simple (X)HTML markup document and has a
diversity of tags in it. While <div> and <span> tags with class and id values will be
common, if they are the majority of the document, you’re likely doing things wrong.

Changing Element Types with display
The CSS specification contains several classification properties that determine the display
classification of a markup element. Is it a block-level element causing a return and acting like
a box, or a smaller inline element generally found within blocks? The CSS1 model recognized
three types of displayed elements: block elements, inline elements, and lists. As you’ll see,
the CSS2 and CSS3 specifications add quite a few more.
The CSS display property allows an element’s display type to be changed. First, the value
of none causes an element to not display or use canvas space. This differs from the property

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

509

setting visibility, to be discussed later, which also prevents an element from displaying, but
does typically reserve canvas space. To turn off a paragraph, try a rule such as the following,
p.remove

{display: none;}

which might be applied to the following markup:
<p>First paragraph (next is display:none).</p>
<p class="remove">Removed second paragraph.</p>
<p>Third paragraph (previous is display:none).</p>

Now visibility is different. If we added a rule like this
p.invisible

{visibility: hidden;}

and applied it to a similar set of paragraphs
<p>Fourth paragraph (next is visibility:hidden).</p>
<p class="invisible">Invisible fifth paragraph.</p>
<p>Sixth paragraph (previous is visibility:hidden).</p>

we see a different result, as the object is still taking up canvas space and is simply invisible:

The point we are making with display is that you have quite a bit of power to affect
how elements are treated in the document tree. Aside from simply turning off elements, you
can make elements fundamentally act differently. For example, we can turn a block element
(such as a paragraph) into an inline element, thus keeping it from adding a new line. For
example, the following would change the form of all paragraphs in the document,
overriding the known action:
p.setasinline

{display: inline;}

When applied to
<p class="setasinline">Inline paragraph.</p>
<p class="setasinline">Inline paragraph.</p>
<p class="setasinline">Inline paragraph.</p>

PART II

This will completely remove the second paragraph from the document tree, as shown here,
where we apply a border to see the paragraphs:

510

Part II:

Core Style

it renders quite differently than without the display modified:

Also, we can do the reverse and make elements that are not normally block act as such:
p.setasblock em {display: block;}

When this is applied to
<p class="setasblock">This paragraph <em>has some</em> <em>emphasis tags
</em> that act as blocks.</p>
<p>This paragraph <em>has some</em> <em>emphasis tags</em> that act normally.</p>

it produces:

You also can coerce an element to act somewhat like a list by casting it with the display
property, as shown here:
p.setaslist em {display:list-item; list-style-position: inside;}

When applied to
<p class="setaslist">List made from em tags: <em>Item</em>
<em>Item</em> </p>

it renders like so:

We might also make a list not act as such by using a rule like
ul li {display: inline;}

<em>Item</em>

Chapter 4:

511

and then applying it to markup like this:
<p>List below not displaying as such</p>

The display property shows us just how far CSS can go in affecting markup. This
powerful property can produce quite elegant results, such as navigation menus, as we shall
see in numerous examples in the book. It is also mandatory when attempting to style XML
elements with no predefined rendering. However, this power can come with a price of
confusion when misapplied.

Controlling White Space
The white-space property controls how spaces, tabs, and newline characters are handled in
an element. The default value, “normal,” collapses whitespace characters into a single space
and automatically wraps lines, just as it normally would in an (X)HTML document. When a
value of “pre” is used for the property, whitespace formatting is preserved, similar to how the
<pre> tag works in (X)HTML. The “nowrap” value prevents lines from wrapping if they
exceed the element’s content width. This simple example demonstrates how the white-space
property works, the rendering of which is shown in Figure 4-12.

As we have seen throughout this section, CSS affords us great power to change the
default characteristics of markup languages like (X)HTML. We presented these properties in
a more expanded form because of their potential for abuse, but by no means should this
advice be construed to suggest that you should avoid such properties, as they are essential
tools in your CSS toolbox. We’ll cover the wide range of other properties available to us in
the following two chapters.

Major Themes of CSS
Before finishing the chapter, we need to take a look at some of the major themes surrounding
the theory and practice of using CSS. Like the concerns of markup, these are deep issues you
will likely encounter over and over again as you design or develop Web sites or applications.
While the questions posed by these themes are fairly easy to describe, they are very difficult
to answer.

Core Style

Separation of Structure and Style
The look of a page should be separate from the markup. You have heard this refrain over
and over in the book, but let’s address it once again. Recall the simple idea that markup files
may have linked style sheets. If we have separated structure and style well, we can change
the linked style and therefore change the look of all the pages that are linked to the style
sheet:

HTML

file.html

CSS

original-style.css

new-style.css

types:

Our main point here is to remind you that the CSS relies on the markup to do its job. It
is not possible to decouple the look from the structure of the document. However, we can
loosely couple it. Do not take this to mean that we suggest markup has some fundamental
presentation advantage over style; it doesn’t.

516

Part II:

Core Style

CSS: More Appropriate and Powerful for Presentation
Style sheets are clearly the way to go for presentation. You can do so much more with CSS
than you could ever do with (X)HTML, such as making text very large, setting backgrounds,
carefully controlling the layout of text, pixel-perfect setting the flow of the page elements,
and more.

You might be able to make the preceding presentation using HTML with images to get the
shadows and rounded corners, but it certainly won’t reflow and it will not have simple
markup that looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>CSS Power!</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="power.css" media="screen">

everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to
Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so
far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted
on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of
comparison only.</p>
</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>

CSS is simply a much more powerful presentation technology than markup.

Cross-Browser CSS Madness
While CSS is certainly more powerful than markup for presentation, it does have its
problems. The browser vendors have made Web designer’s lives miserable for years with
inconsistent, incomplete, and often downright buggy or even broken implementations of
the CSS specification. Things are changing but the required workarounds for now live on.
Earlier in the chapter, we saw purposeful browser errors being used to load other styles.
We might also use other techniques to load different styles to address different browsers. For
example, we could employ Internet Explorer’s proprietary conditional comment technology
to load another style sheet for a specific browser,
<link rel="stylesheet" href="standard.css" media="screen">
<!-- pull nasty IE 6 hacking style sheet -->
<!--[if IE 6]>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="ie6.css" media="screen">
<![endif]-->

or maybe pull in a style sheet for all Internet Explorer versions previous to the nearly
standards-compliant Internet Explorer 8:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="standard.css" media="screen">
<!-- pull older IE style sheet -->
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="oldie.css" media="screen">
<![endif]-->

Conditional comments are unique to Internet Explorer, which really isn’t a problem since
it is usually the browser we desire to “fix” CSS wise. However, if conditional comments
aren’t to your liking, you could also employ simple JavaScript to read the type of browser in
play and include a style sheet as well. We’ll discuss these techniques and others throughout
the book. Our only point here is to stress that the headaches with making CSS work similarly
across browsers are significant and ongoing.

Myths and Misconceptions Related to CSS
Just like markup, CSS is ripe with myths and misconceptions. There is no doubt in the
author’s mind that CSS is the way to go. However, there is plenty of doubt about some of the
statements some CSS zealots make in regard to the technology. A few of the more common

PART II

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch4/csspower.html

518

Part II:

Core Style

claims made are presented here with a bit of discussion about why readers should avoid a
snap judgment about the power of CSS. However, like many things in the world, there is
more than one interpretation, so if this section provokes you to think about both sides, the
point has been successfully made regardless of what your ultimate point of view is.

Myth: Standards Remove Variability

A number of Web professionals pine for some future day when all browsers support W3C
Web standards equally. While it may sound cynical, their wait is likely a long one at the
very best. Even in the case of a widely agreed upon specification, there is always room for
interpretation by implementers. A particular property may have some degree of unclarity in
the extent of its possible usage. Even if it were not the case, once properties are used
together, some unaddressed issues may emerge. It is also quite possible that even with a
good specification, a particular standard feature is not implemented correctly by a browser.
Browser bugs will still exist even in a strict-standards world. It is even more likely that
innovation will continue to occur given market pressures to gain user and developer loyalty,
and variability will continue regardless of specification quality.

Myth: CSS Layouts Are Easier Than Markup Layouts

When CSS examples are simple, accomplishing basic layout tasks looks far easier than in
HTML. However, in practice, some layouts are quite hard to execute, particularly in light of
browser problems. This is not to say you won’t be able to execute a desired design—you
will, and likely more. However, the little tricks and workarounds will lead some designers
to conclude that CSS doesn’t seem worth it. The author doesn’t agree and instead thinks
that this is more likely the case of dealing with the devil you know versus the devil you
don’t. However, it is also likely that there is little truth to the idea that CSS is fundamentally
easier than markup-based layout. Likely, they are equally challenging in different ways and
in different circumstances.

Misconception: Some Browser Vendors Aim for Standards, Some Don’t

Regardless of your particular browser allegiance, the stark reality is that proprietary
features and variability is the name of the game for all browser vendors. All vendors want
to innovate, and even those who vocally promote the cause of standards have numerous
features that other browser vendors may lack. This is not some malicious intent by any
vendor to co-opt the Web standards process, but simply the market reality of trying to
attract Web developers to their platform or retain those already using it. Consider a world
with perfect standardization of implementation; what would that leave browser vendors to
innovate with? If your answer is end-user features, consider that very often such end-user
features have to be specified in markup, style, or script. With well over a decade already of
waiting for the dust to settle in markup and style specifications, the trends simply just don’t
support the belief.

Myth: Using CSS Always Results in Download-Friendly Web Pages

While it is certainly true that table-laden Web pages can get quite bulky and CSS rules can
describe such layouts more succinctly, this simply isn’t always the case, particularly given
the way that CSS is often employed by Web professionals. Quite often, <table>, <tr>, and
<td> tags are simply replaced with nested <div> tags, so the tableless design becomes
a <div>-laden design. Add to this excessive use of long class names and id names,

Chapter 4:

Introduction to CSS

519

particularly without shorthand CSS properties, and CSS designs may actually be much
larger than similar HTML-focused designs. When these styles are used inline or in a
<style> block, the speed gain of CSS over HTML is pretty much eliminated. In the case of
an external style sheet, assuming caching is properly used, download gains may come on
subsequent page views as they do not need to refetch the style information which cached in
the external style sheet. Of course assuming that caching is correctly implemented is not a
given and a blanket assertion that CSS results in more download-friendly pages is false and
does not acknowledge the complexity of page-delivery optimization. Of course, in fairness
it should be noted that even if CSS was always larger, which is not the case, the technology
provides a richer and more appropriate feature set than presentational markup.
A common thought promoted in the Web development community is that redesigning a
Web site is just a matter of changing styles. However, nothing could be farther from the
truth in the author’s experience. Significant redesign often means changing navigation,
changing content, and even changing the focus of a site. A style sheet is not going to apply
necessarily to pages that are fundamentally different in structure and content. This
observation doesn’t suggest style sheets aren’t useful but it should serve to correctly lower
expectations in regard to the simplicity of changing a look during a site redesign. If,
however, the point is simply a new skin for an existing site, CSS clearly can deliver the
promise of a quick new look.

Misconception: CSS Should Support Also Interactivity

Already we see that features implemented in JavaScript like rollovers and menus are being
implemented in CSS using simple pseudo-property selectors like :hover. Some browsers
like Internet Explorer have also implemented proprietary features to associate look to
interactivity, called behaviors. The trend toward blurring the line between presentation and
interaction is clear in HTML5 as well. The challenge we have here is that there is no
difference between making a mess by intermixing content, structure, and look and making a
mess by intermixing style and interaction. A decoupled or, more appropriately, loosely
coupled relationship is the way to go for the same update and separation of concerns goal
discussed so many times before. Unfortunately, like many technologies, we often have to
relearn hard lessons in the light of new environments.

Summary
CSS provides better control over the look and feel of Web pages. Style sheets aren’t just useful
for making attractive pages. By dividing structure and style, they can make documents simpler
to create and easier to manipulate. CSS provides many valuable layout properties that provide
a richer palette for design than presentation markup ever could. CSS should not be considered
a replacement for markup, however, as it relies greatly on correct (X)HTML markup as
well as proper naming of tags. While developers have found the promise of CSS alluring, the
execution of correct style sheets in browsers can be quite challenging. Cross-browser rendering
headaches reemerge with a vengeance under CSS, and we find that the incorrect solutions of
hacking around for filtering and selection shows the necessity of client-side scripting.

T

his chapter provides a complete reference for the properties in the CSS1 and CSS 2.1
specification. Aspects of the CSS2 specification that were not implemented widely,
like the aural properties, are only briefly summarized given their lack of use. The
bulk of the material on CSS3 and emerging and proprietary CSS features can be found in
Chapter 6. However, where appropriate, CSS3 changes that are modifications of traditional
CSS are presented together with the older syntax.

CSS Versions
Cascading Style Sheets is a fairly old technology as far as the Web is concerned. The first
ideas about CSS were presented as early as 1994, and three major versions of the technology
have been developed since then. Table 5-1 summarizes the version history of CSS.

CSS Basics
CSS rules are defined as a property name followed by a colon and then a property value.
Individual rules are terminated by semicolons, with the final rule having an optional
semicolon. The following is the basic syntax:
property-name1 : value1; ... property-nameN : valueN;

CSS1

www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1//

Classic CSS implementation that
introduced text, list, box, margin, border,
color, and background properties. Initially
defined in 1996, most every feature of
CSS1 is supported in Web browsers,
but small quirks do exist around some
lesser-used features like white-space,
letter-spacing, display, and others. Some
problems with CSS1 support are more
significant in older, pre–Internet Explorer 7
browsers.

CSS2

www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/

Specification that is primarily known for
positioning and media, particularly print
style sheet features. Many aspects of
CSS2, such as aural style sheets, were
never widely implemented and were
removed in the later revision of this level
of CSS.

CSS 2.1

www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/

A revision of the CSS2 specification
that makes some corrections and is
normalized to more clearly represent what
most browser vendors have implemented.
Note that many CSS2 features removed
from this specification are found in
CSS3 modules. This is currently the
recommended CSS specification for
study and use.

CSS3

www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work#CSS3

Modularized specification of CSS. Various
modules extend and improve aspects
of previous CSS versions; for example,
the CSS3 Color module addresses color
correction, transparency, and more, while
the CSS3 Fonts module addresses features
to add effects to fonts, adjust their display,
and even download custom fonts. Some
modules are all new, like the Transitions
and Animations modules. In either the
improved or new feature situation, based
upon implementation and specification
maturation rates, readers are encouraged
to check the CSS3 Web site and test well,
because few features are likely to be cross
browser.

Individually, we visually pick out the components of a CSS rule:
Value

Declaration Separation

h1 {font-size: xx-large; color: red;}
Declaration
Selector

Declaration

Rule

Declaration Block

NOTE The final declaration in a style rule block does not require the semicolon. However, for good

CSS property names are separated by dashes when they are multiple words—for example,

font-face, font-size, line-height, and so on. Allowed values come in many forms; from
simple keywords like xx-small, strings like “Arial”, plain numbers like 0, numbers with units
like 100px or 2cm, and special delimited values such as URLs—url(../styles/fancy.css).

All allowed values will be covered in upcoming sections in this chapter.
Property names and many values are not case sensitive but some values may be, as may
selectors, depending on the language CSS is applied to. Web developers should assume that
all components of CSS rules are case sensitive, just to be safe.
CSS rules are applied to markup, and the various style values applied to a particular
element may be inherited from its parent or even a more distant enclosing element. For
example, a rule like:

p {color: red;}

applies the color red to paragraph elements. When applied to
<body>
<h1>Test</h1>
<p>This is a <strong>Test</strong>!</p>

not only is the paragraph element set as red but so too is the <strong> tag enclosed in
the <p> tag because the color property value is inherited from the parent element, as
shown here:
p {color:red;}
body
h1

Whereas most elements can inherit the style features of their parents, some style properties,
such as borders, do not.

measure and easy insertion of future properties, page authors should always use semicolons after
all style properties.

524

Part II:

Core Style

Assuming that a property does inherit, it is still possible to override the inheritance of
a property. For example, given the following two rules:
p
{color: red; font-size: xx-large;}
strong
{color: yellow;}

the color of the text within the <strong> tag would be yellow and have an xx-large size.
Both of the properties were inherited, but the color property was overridden by the color
rule for the <strong> tag, which is more specific:
p {color:red; font-size: xx-large}
strong {color: yellow;}
body
p
strong

Red, xx-large
Override
Inherit
Yellow, xx-large

In any case, it is possible to override the rendering of style by setting the !important
directive at the end of the rule declaration, as follows.
div {font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial ! important;}

A style specified as !important should override any other applied style and thus
should be used sparingly.
While the !important indicator makes things clear, the potentially confusing
combination of applying multiple rules, with elements inheriting some properties and
overriding others, is the idea of the cascade that CSS is named for. The general idea of the
cascade, in effect, is that it provides a system to sort out which rules apply to a document
that has many style sheets. An easy way to think about which rule wins is to follow these
helpful rules of thumb:
• The more specific the rule, the more powerful.
• The closer to the tag the rule, the more powerful.
The specific nature of the rule generally is determined by the selector used, and the
inclusion of the style rule defines the closeness to the markup; both are discussed next.

Style Inclusion Methods
This section reviews the basic methods to associate CSS-based style information with
(X)HTML documents.

Linked Styles
Styles can be contained in an external style sheet linked to a document or a set of
documents, as shown in the following example. Linked information should be placed inside
the <head> tag.
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/newstyle.css">

Chapter 5:

CSS Syntax and Property Reference

525

Given that the link element is an empty element when using XML-style syntax,
a self-identifying close using a trailing slash (/) must be included in the tag:
<!-- XHTML style -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/newstyle.css" />

The rel attribute is generally set to the value stylesheet but may also have a value of
alternate stylesheet with an associated title value to provide different looks for the
same page:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="standard.css" title="standard">

<link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="green.css"
title="Green Sheet">

The media attribute may also be used to define the media to which a style sheet is
applied. The keyword values screen and print are commonly. The default value of all is
applied when media is not specified.
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="screenstyle.css" media="screen">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="printstyle.css" media="print">

CSS2 and 2.1 do define a rich set of media values, as shown in Table 5-2, but in practice
few are supported.

aural

For use with speech synthesizers. Support for this is spotty and most features

Part II:

Core Style

Linked styles are the preferred method of specifying CSS rules because they cleanly
separate the style from the markup. However, do note that using linked styles does come
with the small penalty of an extra HTTP request.

Embedded Styles
Document-wide styles can be embedded in a document’s head element using the <style>
tag. Note that styles should be commented out to avoid interpretation by non-style-aware
browsers.
<style type="text/css">
<!-p {font-size: 1.5em; font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
color: blue; background-color: yellow;}
em {font-size: 2em; color: green;}
-->
</style>

However, be aware that comment masking is frowned upon in XHTML, and instead
you should use linked styles or use a CDATA section like so:
<style type="text/css">
<![CDATA[
p {font-size: 1.5em; font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
color: blue; background-color: yellow;}
em {font-size: 2em; color: green;}
]]>
</style>

Given the support of this structure, particularly with the confusion of XHTML serving and
handling, it is best to avoid this commenting scheme or, better yet, simply stick to linked styles.
It is possible to set a media attribute on a <style> tag to define different types of rules
per output medium:
<style type="text/css" media="print">
/* Print rules here */
</style>
<style type="text/css" media ="screen">
/* Screen rules here */
</style>

Imported Styles—@import
Within embedded <style> blocks, properties can be imported from an external file and
expanded in place, similar to a macro. Importing can be used to include multiple style
sheets. An imported style is defined within a <style> tag using @import followed
optionally by a type value and a URL for the style sheet:
<style type="text/css">
@import url(newstyle.css);
@import print url(printstyle.css);
</style>

Chapter 5:

CSS Syntax and Property Reference

527

The @import directive allows style sheets to be grouped and joined together, though
some might wonder what the value of this function is given what linked styles provide.

NOTE Some CSS developers use the @import directive to perform a weak form of browser

selection, because many older CSS implementations do not support the directive. The basic idea
of the trick is to put sophisticated style rules in an @import style sheet and leave basic styles in
the style block. This trick should be avoided, particularly given that some browsers, notably
versions of Internet Explorer, will cause a disturbing flash effect when loading imported styles.

You can apply styles directly to elements in a document using the core attribute style, as
shown next. As the closest style-inclusion method to a tag, inline styles take precedence
over document-wide or linked styles.
<h1 style="font-size: 48px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
color: green;">CSS Test</h1>

Given the tight intermixture of style into markup, this scheme should be used sparingly.
Note that some features of CSS, particularly pseudo-class–related values such as link states,
may not be settable using this method. Further note that there is no way to set mediaspecific style rules inline on individual elements.

CSS Measurements
CSS supports a number of measurements. In most cases, they involve a number, and CSS
supports both positive and negative integer values, like 3 and –14, as well as real numbers
like 3.75. Very often the numbers are found with units; for example,
p {margin: 5px;} /* all margins set to 5 pixels */

But in a few cases they may not have units, as the measurement may be contextual from
the meaning of the property:
p {line-height: 2;}

/* double spaced */

When a measurement is zero, there is no need for a unit,
* {margin: 0;}

but it won’t hurt to include one:
* {margin: 0px;}

Commonly, absolute length units like inches (in), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm),
points (pt), and picas (pc) are used. These absolute measures should be used when the
physical characteristics of the display medium are well understood, such as in printing. We
also might use relative measures that can scale, such as em units, ex values, percentage, or
pixels. Table 5-3 summarizes these units of measure.

Measurement

Description

Example

%

Defines a measurement as a
percentage. Percentages are denoted
by a number followed by the % symbol
and are always relative to another value
such as length. Quite often they are
used to specify some value relative
to an inherited value from a parent
element.

p {font-size: 14px;
line-height: 150%;}

cm

Defines a measurement in centimeters.

div {margin-bottom: 1cm;}

em

Defines a measurement relative to the
height of a font in em spaces. Because
an em unit is equivalent to the size of a
given font, if you assign a font to 12pt,
each em unit would be 12pt, thus 2em
would be 24pt.

p {letter-spacing: 5em;}

ex

Defines a measurement relative
to a font’s x-height. The x-height is
determined by the height of the font’s
lowercase letter x.

p {font-size: 14pt;
line-height: 2ex;}

in

Defines a measurement in inches.

p {word-spacing: .25in;}

mm

Defines a measurement in millimeters.

p {word-spacing: 12mm;}

pc

Defines a measurement in picas. A pica
is equivalent to 12 points; thus, there
are 6 picas per inch.

p {font-size: 10pc;}

pt

Defines a measurement in points. A
point is defined as 1/72nd of an inch. A
point does not equate to a pixel unless
there are 72 pixels per inch onscreen.

body {font-size: 14pt;}

px

Defines a measurement in screen
pixels. Surprising to some Web
developers, pixel measurements are
relative, as there may be different pixel
densities on different screens.

p {padding: 15px;}

TABLE 5-3 CSS1 and CSS2 Length Measurement Units

NOTE There are many other values found in CSS3, such as viewport sizes (vh, vw, vm), root

relative sizing (rem), angles [degrees (deg), grads (grad), and radians (rad)], times
[milliseconds (ms) and seconds (s)], frequencies [Hertz (Hz) and kilo Hertz (kHz)], and so on.
See Chapter 6 for information on these and other values.

CSS Strings and Keywords
In CSS, strings are defined with either single quotes ('example') or double quotes
("example"). Quotes may be found within the opposite quote ("I say this is an
'example'!"). Commonly, strings are found when specifying a font name, like so:
p {font-family: "Fancy Font";}

We also find that strings may be used with selectors:
a[title="Match me match me"] {color: red;}

a[title="Next\
Line here"] {color: red;}

More common than quoted strings are the numerous keyword values found in CSS. The
number of keywords is vast and is used for specifying sizes,
.big {font-size: xx-large;}
.small {font-size: small;}
.downsize {font-size: smaller;}

border styles,
.double {border: 5px solid black;}
.dashed {border-style: dashed;}

text formatting and style,
.style1 {text-decoration: underline;}
.style2 {font-variant: small-caps;}
.style3 {font-weight: bold;}

element meaning,
#nav {display: block;}
#gone {display: none;}
#test {display: inline;}

layout,
#region1 {position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 10px;}
#region2 {position: relative; top: -60px; left: 100px;}
#region3 {position: fixed; top: 0px; left: 0px;}

and more.

PART II

There is an occasional need for special characters in strings; in particular, newlines may
be specified with a "\00000a" value. In situations where a newline is typed, a \ character
can be used as line continuation:

530

Part II:

Core Style

In some situations, the keyword may be part of a functional style notation. For example,
in CSS the specification of a URL as a value is marked by url(address), where address is
the actual value of the resource to be linked to:
body {background: url(stars.png);}
#div1 {background: url(http://democompany.com/images/tile.gif);}

Newer color formats like rgb(), rgba(), hsl(), and hsla() are set with similar
notation, and other functional notation style values may emerge over time such as calc()
(see Chapter 6 for a brief discussion). For example, there is discussion of CSS potentially
including variables which allows values to be set in one place and used in various rules. For
example,
@variables {
primaryBackground: #F8D;
primaryColor: #000;
defaultMargin: 2em;
}
p {color: var(primaryColor); background-color: var(primaryBackground);
margin: var(defaultMargin);}

So far such ideas are still uncommon, so if a value is not found within quotes or followed by
a measurement, it is likely a keyword or counter. If it isn’t or is simply not an understood
value, it will be ignored by CSS-conforming user agents anyway.

Counters
Counters demonstrate the possibility of variable-like values in CSS. They are defined as
alphanumeric names that correspond to some current counter value in a document. In some
cases, the counter( ) functional notation is used and in some cases it is not, as shown by
these rules:
ol.cT {
counter-reset: counter1;
list-style-type: none;}
ol.cT li:before {
counter-increment: counter1;
content:
counter(counter1) " - " ;}

Interestingly, the ambiguity of allowing the counter1 value to appear in a keyword-like
fashion is somewhat troubling. It is likely that the counter( ) style syntax will eventually
be applied everywhere.

CSS Color Values
Style sheets support a variety of color measurement values, as shown in Table 5-4. Appendix C
provides a greater discussion of possible color values and names.

Specificationdefined named
colors

There are 17 defined colors under CSS 2.1.
Each is listed here with its six-digit hex form
equivalence:
maroon (#800000) red (#ff0000)
orange (#ffA500) yellow (#ffff00)
olive (#808000) purple (#800080)
fuchsia (#ff00ff ) white (#ffffff)
lime (#00ff00) green (#008000)
navy (#000080) blue (#0000ff)
aqua (#00ffff) teal (#008080)
black (#000000) silver (#c0c0c0)
gray (#808080)
Other color keywords may be commonly
used but are ad hoc in their definition.
See Appendix C for more information.
Most browsers support a number of
common colors based upon the X11
windowing system palette, such as
mintcream. Appendix C provides a
complete list of these extended colors
and a discussion of the potential pitfalls
of using them.
CSS2 introduced named color keywords
which allows Web page colors to be
matched to an operating system’s color
use. A complete list of the allowed values
and their meaning is found in Appendix C.
While these names are commonly
supported, there is some concern that
they will not be supported in CSS3.
CSS’s six-digit hexadecimal format is
the same as color defined in (X)HTML.
The format specifies color as #rrggbb,
where rr is the amount of red, gg the
amount of green, and bb the amount of
blue, all specified in a hexadecimal value
ranging from 00 to FF.
This is an RGB hexadecimal format of
#rgb, where r corresponds to a hex
value (0–F) for red, g for green, and b for
blue. For example, #f00 would specify
pure red, while #fff would specify white.
Given its data limits, the format is less
expressive than 6-Hex Color.

HSL Color

CSS3 introduces Hue Saturation
Lightness (HSL), where color values are
specified as hsl(hue,saturation,
lightness). Hue is set as the degree
on the color wheel, where 0 or 360 if
you wrap around is red, 120 is green,
and 240 is blue, with the various other
colors found between. Saturation is
a percentage value, with 100% being
the fully saturated color. Lightness is a
percentage value, with 0% being dark and
100% light with the average 50% being
the norm.
This is the CSS3 HSL value with a fourth
value to set the alpha channel value
for the color to define the opacity of
the element. An HSLa is specified via a
function style hsla(hue,saturation,
lightness, alpha), where hue,
saturation, and lightness are the same
as standard hsl() values, and the alpha
channel value for defining opacity is a
number between 0 (fully transparent) and
1 (fully opaque).
CSS colors can also be defined using
the keyword rgb, followed by three
numbers between 0 and 255, contained in
parentheses and separated by commas,
with no spaces between them. RGB
color values can also be defined using
percentages. The format is the same,
except that the numbers are replaced by
percentage values between 0% and 100%.
This is like RBG color but adds an alpha
channel value to specify the opacity of
the color. An RGBa is specified via a
function-style rgba(r,g,b,a) value,
where colors r, g, and b are specified
as a decimal value from 0 to 255 or a
percentage from 0% to 100%, and the
alpha channel value for defining opacity
is a number between 0 (fully transparent)
and 1 (fully opaque). Values outside this
range will be rounded up or down to fit the
closest value.

PART II

CSS supports a rich set of selectors for specifying to which particular element(s) a CSS rule
applies. CSS1 initially supported basic selectors to indicate a particular tag, group of tags, or
position in the document tree. CSS2 expanded this to address selecting on attributes and
more positions in the tree. We show here pieces of CSS3, which has gone somewhat
overboard by making selector syntax at times potentially quite confusing, particularly when
chained excessively. Given that many browsers support this emerging selector syntax, it is
important to show it together with the other selectors as a complete reference. Table 5-5
summarizes the selector syntax from CSS1, CSS2, and the commonly supported parts of the
CSS3 specifications. A summary and expansion of CSS3 selectors to include those that are
less supported is provided in Chapter 6.

Miscellaneous CSS Constructs
This section discusses some miscellaneous constructs associated with style sheets.

/* comments */
Comments can be placed within style sheets. Style sheets use the comment syntax used in C
programming (/*comment*/):
<style type="text/css">
p {font-face: Courier; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;
background-color: yellow;}
/* This style sheet was created at Demo Company, Inc. for the express purpose
of being an example in HTML & CSS: The Complete Reference, 5th Edition */
/* Oh by the way people can see your comments so think twice about what you
put in them */
</style>

HTML comment syntax (<!-- comment -->) does not apply in CSS. However, as
discussed previously in the “Style Inclusion Methods” section, HTML comments are often
used to mask style blocks:
<style type="text/css">
<!-p {font-size: 1.5em; font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;

PART II

Description

539

540

Part II:

Core Style

color: blue; background-color: yellow;}
em {font-size: 2em; color: green;}
-->
</style>

Internet Explorer’s conditional comments are also found in CSS for masking linked style
sheets for one browser or another. See entry on comments in the reference found in Chapter 3
for more details.

@charset
A single @charset rule can be used in an external sheet to define character set encoding of
the style rules and values.

Example
@charset "ISO-8859-1"
/* external style sheet rules follow below */

Note
• This rule should never be used in an embedded style sheet, as there are many other
ways to indicate character sets with a <meta> tag or an HTTP header.

@font-face
This “at” rule is used to associate a font name to be used in a style sheet with some
downloadable font. A font-family property is used within the rule to name the font
and a src property is associated with an external font name:
@font-face {font-family: fontname;
src: url(fontfile);}

Later, the font can be used as a name within properties like font-family and font,
though you should specify other font names as a fallback in case downloadable font
technology is not supported or the font fails to load for some reason.

Examples
@font-face {font-family: "Mufferaw";
src: url(MUFFERAW.ttf);}
body {font-family: "Mufferaw", serif; font-size: 5em;}

It is also possible to set selection of a particular downloadable font when a particular font
characteristic like bold or italic is set, by adding the corresponding rule to the @font-face rule:
@font-face {font-family: "Mufferaw";
src: url(MUFFERAW.ttf);}
@font-face {font-family: "Mufferaw";
src: url(MUFFERAWBOLD.ttf);
font-weight: bold;}
p {font-family: "Mufferaw", serif; font-size: 5em;}
em {font-weight: bold;} /* would specify the Mufferaw bold font */

Chapter 5:

CSS Syntax and Property Reference

541

Note
• The particular font technologies for downloadable fonts vary significantly between
browsers. Internet Explorer has supported EOT files since IE 4. Netscape supported
TrueDoc downloadable fonts but these were phased out. Firefox 3.5, Safari 3, and
Opera 10 have reintroduced downloadable fonts using TrueType files. See Appendix B
for examples of mixing the various technologies.

@media
Examples
<style type="text/css">
@media screen { /* screen rules */ }
@media print { /* print rules */ }
@media screen, print { /* screen and print rules */ }
</style>

The syntax may look a little odd because you have to wrap style blocks with more curly
braces, like so:
<style type="text/css">
@media screen {body
{font-family: sans-serif;
font-size: 14px;}
}
@media print {body
{font-family: serif;
font-size: 10px;}
}
</style>

A variation of this syntax with device constraints, dubbed a “Media Query,” is supported in
many browsers and is discussed in Chapter 6.

@page
An @page rule is used to define a page block for printed styles. Generally, within this
construct we see various CSS properties like size, page, and margin to control the
dimensions of the page.

Examples
/* sets tables to be on landscape pages */
@page {size: 8.5in 11in; margin: .5in;}
@page {marks: crop;}
/* we can name particular page's rules as well with an identifier */
@page report {size: landscape;}

PART II

An @media rule can be used to define style rules for multiple media types in a single
embedded style sheet.

542

Part II:

Core Style

/* pseudo-classes can be used to select alternating pages as well
as the first page */
@page :left {margin: .5in;}
@page :right {margin: 1.5in;}
@page :first {margin: 5in;}

Note
• This construct is not well supported, even in modern browsers.

!important
This construct specifies that a style takes precedence over any different, conflicting styles.
This construct should be used sparingly.

Examples
body {font-family: Times;}
div {font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial ! important;}
#div1 {font-family: Sans-Serif;}
/* all divs, no matter how used, will be in Arial, see !important */

CSS1 and CSS 2.1 Properties
This section presents the CSS1 and 2.1 properties in alphabetical order. CSS2 properties that
were dropped from the CSS 2.1 specification are presented in Chapter 6, which covers
emerging and proprietary CSS properties.
Note that the properties tend to come in groups and that most groups have shorthand
notation. For example, the background property is shorthand for background-color,
background-image, background-position, and background-attachment. Individual
properties of a set may contain extra details, which are noted in the corresponding section
for that property and are not necessarily repeated in the section for the shorthand entry of
the set.
The property entries that follow generally include the following information:
• Brief summary Brief summary of the property’s purpose.
• Syntax Syntax for the element, including allowed values defined by the W3C
specification.
• Example(s)

One or more examples demonstrating use of the property.

• Compatibility The property’s general compatibility with CSS specifications and
browser versions.
• Note(s) Additional information about the property or its usage. This may include
some CSS3 details for properties that are only slightly modified in the emerging
specification. The bulk of the CSS3 information is presented in Chapter 6.
All the values allowed with a property are defined in the earlier section “CSS
Measurements.” Similarly, the examples assume that you understand selectors, which
are summarized in the earlier section “CSS Selectors.”

background
This property sets in a shorthand form any or all background properties.

Syntax
background:

background-color background-image background-repeat
background-attachment background-position;

Examples
body {background: white url(picture.gif) repeat-y center;}
.red {background: #ff0000;}
#div1 {background: white url(logo.gif) no-repeat fixed 10px 10px;}

Compatability
CSS 1, 2, 3

IE 4+

Netscape 4 (buggy), 6+, Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• As with all shorthand forms, document authors should experiment with individual
background-related property values before adopting a short form.
• Under the emerging CSS3 specification, it is possible to specify multiple files for a
background and separate each with a comma. For example,
body {background: white url(donkey.gif) top left no-repeat,
url(elephant.gif) bottom right no-repeat;}

would put a background image in the top-left and bottom-right areas of the body,
respectively. Support is limited, though Safari 1.3+ browsers support most CSS3
background features.

background-attachment
This property sets the background image to scroll or not to scroll with its associated element’s
content. The default value is scroll, which sets the background to scroll with the associated
content, typically text. The alternate value, fixed, is intended to make the background static
while associated content such as text scrolls over the background. A value of inherit applies
the value of this property from a containing parent element.

Syntax
background-attachment: scroll | fixed | inherit

Examples
body {background-image: url(tile.gif); background-attachment: scroll;}
#logo {background-image: url(logo.gif); background-attachment: fixed;}

background-color
This property sets an element’s background color. A wide variety of color values, as detailed
earlier in Table 5-4, can be used, while the default value, transparent, allows any
underlying content to show through.

Syntax
background-color: color | transparent | inherit

Examples
.red {background-color: #FF0000;}
.red2 {background-color: #F00;}
.red3 {background-color: red;}
.red4 {background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);}

Notes
• This property is often used in conjunction with the color property. If both
properties are not set, it is possible to have rendering problems in the unlikely event
that the browser default colors hide content because colors are too similar. The W3C
CSS validator will warn of the possibility of this rare but troubling issue.
• Used with block elements, this property colors content and padding but not
margins.

background-image
This property associates a background image with an element. Underlying content may
show through transparent regions in the source image. The background image requires a
URL (complete or relative) to link it to the source image specified with the url( ) syntax.
The default value is none and sets the background so that it doesn’t display an image.

Syntax
background-image: url(image-file) | none | inherit

• Under the emerging CSS3 specification, it is possible to specify background images
and separate each with a comma. For example,
body {background-image: url(donkey.gif), url(elephant.gif);}

However, without positioning of the backgrounds or transparency, you may
obscure images. Support is limited, though Safari 1.3+ browsers support most CSS3
background-image features.

background-position
This property determines how a background image is positioned within the canvas space
used by its associated element. The position of the background image’s upper-left corner
can be specified as an absolute distance, typically in pixels, from the surrounding element’s
origin. It can also be specified as a relative unit, nearly always a percentage, along the
horizontal and vertical dimensions. Finally, the position can be specified as named values
that describe the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The named values for the horizontal
axis are center, left, and right; those for the vertical axis are top, center, and bottom.
The default value for an unspecified dimension when only a single value is given is
assumed to be center.

Syntax
background-position: horizontal vertical

where horizontal is
percentage | length | left | center | right

and vertical is
percentage | length | top | center | bottom

Examples
body

{background-image: url(plaidpattern.gif);
background-position: 50px 100px;}

• According to the CSS 2.1 specification, the tiling and positioning of background
images on inline elements is undefined. In practice, browsers tend to support it.
• When keywords are solely used, the ordering of values is not important.
• Under CSS3 you may specify multiple background-position values and separate
them with commas. Each value will then be applied to the corresponding background
in the list of backgrounds. For example, background-position: 50px 100px,
200px 200px; would position the first background at 50px, 100px and the second
background at 200px, 200px. Support is limited, though Safari 1.3+ browsers support
most CSS3 background-position features.

background-repeat
This property determines how background images specified by the property background
or background-image tile when they are smaller than the canvas space used by their
associated elements. Possible values are repeat (repeats in both direction), repeat-x
(repeats only horizontally), repeat-y (repeats vertically), and no-repeat. The default
value is repeat.

Syntax
background-repeat: repeat | repeat-x | repeat-y | no-repeat | inherit

Notes
• This property is often used in conjunction with the background-color property. If
both properties are not set, it is possible to have rendering problems when default
color values hide content. The W3C CSS validator will warn of this dangerous
though unlikely issue.
• A concern with this property is not whether it is supported, but what CSS color
values are supported. Developers should assume that hsl() and other emerging
CSS3 values are more dangerous to use than standard keywords or hex values.

content
This property generates content in a document and is used with the :before and :after
pseudo-elements.

Syntax
content: normal | none | string | url() | counter | attr(X) | open-quote |
close-quote | no-open-quote | no-close-quote | inherit

The most commonly used string value simply inserts the defined quote-delimited string
either before or after the selected element depending on the rule in use:
div.section:before {content: "Section Name: ";}

The url value is used to insert an external resource, typically an image:
div.section:before {content: url(warning.png);}

It is possible to combine values,
div.section:before {content: "Danger danger! " url(warning.png) " Generated
Content Ahead ";}

and the generated content can be styled by further applied properties:
div.section:before {content: "Danger danger! ";
font-size: xx-large; background-color: black;
color: yellow;}

Counter values can be specified and used to automatically add a sequential indicator. It
is generally defined in the form of counter(name), where name is the name of the counter,
or counter(name, style), where style indicates the list-style-type to use:
ol.countTest li:before {content: counter(counter1)

" - " ;}

Chapter 5:

CSS Syntax and Property Reference

563

Multiple counters can be employed to allow for nesting of counter values if the

counters() function is employed. This is commonly used with outline style lists:
/* counter nesting example with counters() function showing a
value.value style outline */
ol.nest {counter-reset: counter1; list-style-type: none;}
ol.nest ol {list-style-type: none; counter-reset: counter1;}
ol.nest li:before {counter-increment: counter1;
content: counters(counter1,".") " : "; }

q {quotes: '<< ' ' >>' "( " " )";}
/* Insert quotes before and after q element content */
q:before {content: open-quote;}
q:after {content: close-quote;}

The no-open-quote and no-close-quote values do not insert quotation symbols but
do increment or decrement the nesting level for quotes.
Finally, the attr(X) syntax returns a string value for the attribute X for the element the
rule is associated with. For example,
#p1:before

{content: attr(title);}

when applied to
<p id="p1" title="Text from the title here! ">I am the paragraph</p>

would insert the title attribute’s content “Text from the title here!” before the paragraph.
Though if the related element does not have an attribute named X, an empty string is used.

Examples
div.section:before {content: "Section "; font-size: xx-large;}
#div1:before {content: url(sectionstart.gif);}
#div1:after {content: url(sectionend.gif);}
blockquote:before {content: open-quote;}
blockquote:after {content: close-quote;}
p:before {content: counter(par-num, upper-roman) ". " }
p:before {content: attr(title); }

Note
• When using attribute matches (attr(X)) for content, note that browsers may read
attributes of any name regardless of validity, but do not assume that this is the
action, because it depends greatly on the markup technology employed and how
it is supported in a browser.

counter-increment
This property controls CSS counter values.

Syntax
counter-increment: counter-name1 [integer] ... counter-nameN [integer] |
none | inherit

The syntax shows the property accepts one or more counter names (counter-nameX), each
one optionally followed by an integer. The integer indicates by how much the counter is
incremented or decremented for every occurrence of the element. The default increment is 1.
Zero and negative integers are allowed.

Examples
div.section:before {content: "Section: " counter(section) ". ";
counter-increment: section;}
/* Add 1 to section */
h1.chapter:before

{content: counter(chapterno, upper-latin) ". ";

counter-reset: counter-name1 [integer] ... counter-nameN [integer] | none |
inherit

The syntax shows the property accepts one or more names of counters, each one optionally
followed by an integer. The integer indicates what the counter value should be set to; when
a value is not specified, the counter is set to 0.

Examples
div.chapter {counter-reset: section;}
/* Set section to 0 */
ol {counter-reset: sectioncount listcount x y;}
/* Sets four counters to 0 */
#foo {counter-reset: globalCount 5;}

cursor
This property determines how the cursor displays when passed over the affected element.

Syntax

The default value, auto, leaves the cursor display to be determined by the user agent, so the
cursor will display according to either the browser defaults or the user system settings. The
common renderings of the values listed in CSS 2.1 are shown in Table 5-7.
The value url() can be used to reference a cursor source; multiple cursor sources
should be listed. As with fonts, the user agent should attempt to render the first cursor
listed, try the second one if necessary, and ultimately default to the generic cursor value
listed last, which should be listed though it is likely to default to auto appropriately in
conformant browsers:
<p style="cursor: url(greenarrow.cur), url(greenarrow.png), auto">Custom</p>

Note that the file type of the cursor linked to will depend on what the browser may support,
and some browsers, such as Internet Explorer, may allow for animated cursors.
CSS3 adds a number of new cursor values, including the ability to turn the cursor off
completely. While it is unclear the extent of new cursors that CSS3 will introduce, given its
raw state, many have been implemented already in modern browsers. Table 5-8 overviews
these and provides renderings where possible.
For more information on emerging CSS3 cursors, see www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#cursor.

Examples
.help {cursor: help;}
p.clickable {cursor: hand;} /* non-standard */
a:longload {cursor: wait;}

Note
• While the direction property can easily affect block elements, for it to affect
inline-level elements, the unicode-bidi property value must be embed or

display
This property specifies an element’s display type and can override an element’s defined
presentation.

Syntax
display: inline | block | list-item | run-in | inline-block | table |
inline-table | table-row-group | table-header-group |
table-footer-group | table-row | table-column-group | table-column |
table-cell | table-caption | none | inherit

The value inline causes an element to act it were an inline element with no returns added,
as shown here:

A value of block causes the element to generate a block box:

Chapter 5:

CSS Syntax and Property Reference

569

A list-item value creates a block for the list box and an inline box for items:

Browsers typically don’t implement this value, and there is some question of its value.
CSS 2 supports numerous table-related values, such as defining an element to act as a
table:

or to act as a cell:

PART II

The value of run-in is somewhat context based and will make the item inline or block
depending on the context. Basically, if a block box that is not floated or positioned follows
the run-in box it becomes the first inline box of the block, otherwise, it becomes a block:

570

Part II:

Core Style

Based upon the values listed, it is also possible to define the element to act as a group of
cells or other aspects of a table, though the practical application and support for such values
is fuzzy at best.
Probably the most important value for the display property is none, which completely
removes an element from the document tree and, unlike the hidden value of the
visibility property, does not preserve an element’s canvas space, as demonstrated here:

Examples
#p1 {display: inline;} /* run this element as an inline */
b
{display: block;}
.navigation {display: none;}
/* consider turning off items in a print style */

Compatibility
CSS 1, 2, 3

IE 4+

Netscape 4+ (buggy), 6+, Firefox 1+

Opera 5+, Safari 1+

Notes
• The property itself is commonly supported but the values are not.
• CSS1 only defines inline, block, list-item, and none. Designers are encouraged
to utilize these common values first.
• Be careful about changing the a priori display aspects of defined elements. Making
all <b> tags act as blocks like <p> tags or making <p> tags render inline decreases
the understandability of markup.

empty-cells

font
This property provides a shorthand way to specify all font properties with one rule.

Syntax
font: font-style font-variant font-weight font-size/line-height font-family;

It is not necessary to include all properties, and the lists of variant fonts should be separated
by commas, with those font names consisting of more than one word placed in quotes. The
allowed values are found in each individual property entry.

Examples
p {font: normal small-caps bold 12pt/18pt "Times New Roman", Courier, serif;}
.super {font: italic 18pt sans-serif;}

Compatibility

Note
• This emerging CSS3 specification specifies more font-related properties, such as
font-effect, but interestingly none is replicated in the short form as of yet.
• As with all shorthand forms, document authors should experiment with individual
background-related property values before adopting a short form.

font-family
This property sets the font face to be used for text.

Syntax
font-family: font 1 [, font 2, ... font N]

Fonts may be named specifically or a generic font family name may be used. When multiple
font names are specified and separated by commas, they are read in descending order
looking for the first match. Generally, a generic font name will be listed at the end of a font
list. There are five generic font names currently available: serif, sans-serif, cursive,

Notes
• This property is equivalent to the face attribute of a <font> tag.
• Under many browsers, downloadable fonts are supported. See the entry for
@font-face earlier in the reference.
• Fonts are listed in comma-separated form, generally ending with a known available
built-in CSS font.

font-size
This property sets the font size of text.

Syntax
font-size: length | percentage | larger | smaller | xx-small | x-small |
small | medium | large | x-large | xx-larger | inherit

574

Part II:

Core Style

Lengths are set often in points (pt), pixels (px), picas (pc), inches (in), millimeters (mm), or
centimeters (cm). Standard relative sizing units in em (em) and x-height (ex) may also
be used, as well as percentage values like 90%. Percentage values set the font size to a
percentage of the current inherited font-size. The property also supports size keywords
(xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large). The size keywords are
roughly equivalent to the 1–7 size values for a <font> tag and also should be equivalent to
particular stock HTML heading sizes. Table 5-9 summarizes the typical relationship between
CSS and HTML, though implementations may vary.
The relative size keywords larger and smaller should adjust a current size up or
down one value.

Examples
body
{font-size: 18pt;}
#heading1 {font-size: 36px;}
p
{font-size: 2em;}
h6
{font-size: xx-small;}
.special {font-size: 75%;}

font-variant
Syntax
font-variant: normal | small-caps | inherit

The small-caps value sets text in smaller-size all capitals. The normal value would be

Note
• The small-caps style is often used in license and legal agreements—put in all capitals

font-weight
This property sets the weight, or relative boldness, of text.

Syntax
font-weight: normal | bold | bolder | lighter | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 |
600 | 700 | 800 | 900 | inherit

Values can be set with named values (normal or bold) or with numbered values (100–900).
In practice, under most browsers the values 100–500 display as normal text; 600–900 display
as bold. Relative values of lighter or bolder will increase or decrease the font-weight
value relative to its surrounding weight.

Examples
.bold
{font-weight: bold;}
#light
{font-weight: 300;}
.superbold {font-weight: 900;}

Notes
• Support for varying degrees of light or bold beyond simple bold or not bold is
generally not implemented by browsers though theoretically printing may support
such distinctions.
• Theoretically, application of bold to a font may allow a mapping from one font like
Helvetica to a related font like Helvetica Bold or Helvetica Black. In practice, such
mappings don’t happen.

height
This property sets the height of an element’s content region.

Syntax
height: length | percentage | auto | inherit

Standard positive length units can be used, and pixels (px) is often the assumed measurement
in browsers. Percentage values, based on the height of the containing element, can also be
used. The default value of auto automatically calculates the width of an element, based on
the height of the containing element and the size of the content.

Examples
p {height: 400px; width: 200px; padding: 10px; border: solid 5px;}
#div1 {height: 50%; width: 50%;}

Compatibility
CSS 1, 2, 3

IE 4+

Netscape 4+, Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• The actual size of an object on a browser canvas is not solely defined by the height
property, as values for borders and padding affect the space taken. For example,
given the CSS here
#div1 {height: 200px; padding: 30px; border: solid 20px;}

Chapter 5:

left
This property defines the x (horizontal) coordinate for a positioned element, relative to the
left side of the containing element or browser window.

Syntax
left: length | percentage | auto | inherit

where length can be specified in the standard units of length, such as inches (in) and so on,
but is nearly always set in pixels (px), and percentage corresponds to a percentage of the
containing object’s dimensions. The default value, auto, lets this property function as placing
the object where it normally would fall in the document flow. For relative position, this will
likely be treated as 0. For absolute and fixed positioning, it will calculate a value based upon
other set properties, particularly right.

Examples
#div1 {position: absolute; left: 100px; top: 150px;}
#div2 {position: absolute; left: 50%; top: 30%;}
#div3 {position: absolute; left: auto; right: 500px; bottom: 5px; top: auto;}

value normal.

Examples

Note
• This property does not enable full kerning of text as it will not be possible to adjust
the space between two adjacent kerning pairs of letters without crossing tags. In
short because of the way markup and style intersect, it simply is not possible to
perfectly adjust spacing differently on either side of a letter. However, given the
fluid nature of screen displays, what is provided for is likely more than adequate.

line-height
This property sets the height (leading) between lines of text in a block-level element such as
a paragraph.

Syntax
line-height: number | length | percentage | normal | inherit

Values can be specified as a number of lines, a number of units (pixels, points, inches,
centimeters, and so on), or a percentage of the font size. Negative values are not allowed.
The default value of normal is typically equivalent to 1.0 to 1.2 depending on the
implementation.

Examples
.double {line-height: 2;}
.double2 {line-height: 200%;}
p

upper-latin | armenian | georgian | lower-alpha |
upper-alpha | none | inherit

The value none prevents a list label from displaying. CSS1 defines disc, circle, and
square, which are typically used on unordered lists (<ul>). The values decimal, lowerroman, upper-roman, lower-alpha, and upper-alpha are typically used on ordered lists
(<ol>). These property types correspond to the (X)HTML type attributes for lists. CSS2
adds more values, primarily for ordered lists in foreign languages.

Examples
ol
{list-style-type: upper-roman;}
ol.none {list-style-type: none;}
.ichi-ni {list-style-type: hiragana;}

Notes
• The general characteristics of this property are supported by the type attribute for
the <ol>, <ul>, and <li> (X)HTML tags.
• CSS2 also included values, such as hebrew, cjk-ideographic, hiragana,
katakana, hiragana-iroha, and katakana-iroha. These values were later
removed from the CSS 2.1 specification.
• CSS3 includes many more list-style-type values, such as arabic, binary,
lower hexadecimal, mongolian, thai, ethiopic, hangul, norwegian, and
somali.

margin
This property sets a consistent margin on all four sides of the affected element.

Syntax
margin: margin1 ... margin4 | inherit

where each margin value is either a length, percentage, auto, or inherit value. As a
shorthand form, it is possible to set the four margin values (margin-top, margin-right,
margin-bottom, and margin-left) independently with this property:
1 margin-top
Border
Padding

margin-left

Content

margin-right

2

4

3 margin-bottom

A single value will be copied to all four margins. With two values, the first value will
specify the top and bottom margins, and the second value will specify the right and left
margins. If three values are specified, the first defines the top margin, the second defines the
left and right margins, and the third defines the bottom margin. Note that the unspecified
margin is inferred from the value defined for its opposite side. Lastly, all four values can
also be set in order of top, right, bottom, left.

outline
This property is a shorthand form that sets all outline properties at once.

Syntax
outline: outline-color outline-style outline-width;

The allowed values are similar to border. The meaning of each is detailed in each individual
property that follows. While outlines are similar to borders, their individual sides cannot be
set. No matter how outline properties are set they apply to the whole outline and not
individual sides.

While outlines may resemble borders, they take up no additional space and may overlay
other content outside of a block if need be, as shown here:

Because outlines are drawn over an item, rather than around it, they cause no reflow
when applied dynamically:

Notes
• Older Firefox- and Mozilla-based browsers like Netscape 6+ could set this value
using a proprietary property –moz-outline.
• The outline is the same on all sides. Unlike borders, there is no sense of outlinetop or outline-left. This apparent omission should make perfect sense when
considering nonrectangular outlines.
• There is unclarity in the specification and implementation on what to do with
overlapping outlines, outlines around empty items, and outlines that may surround
partially obscured elements. Be aware in such cases of unclarity that visual
differences may occur. For example, notice here that one browser created two
separated outline boxes, given it surrounds empty elements, whereas in the
previous illustration the empty elements were outlined:

outline-color
This property sets the color of an element’s outline.

Syntax
outline-color: color | invert | inherit

where color is a supported CSS color value, as discussed earlier in the chapter. The keyword
invert is also supported and should perform a color inversion on the pixels on the
screen. In other words, any background would be inverted for the outline:

Chapter 5:

CSS Syntax and Property Reference

589

In the case where there are two colors, this can change the outline in various locations.
The following example changes the outline in one case to black given a white background
and changes it to blue given an orange background:

Examples
{outline-style: dashed; outline-color: green; outline-width: 1px;}
{outline-width: 10px; outline-style: solid; outline-color: #f00;}
{outline-color: invert;}

Compatibility

Notes
• Many browsers do not support the invert value the same and may invert based
upon one color in the case of multiple colors found in different areas of an element’s
background.
• Older Firefox- and Mozilla-based browsers like Netscape 6+ could set this value
using a proprietary property –moz-outline-color.

outline-style
This property defines a style for an element’s outline.

Syntax
outline-style: dashed | dotted | double | groove | inset | none | outset |
ridge | solid | inherit

The values supported should be the same as what is defined for border-style except the
value hidden which is not defined for this property.

• See the entry for the border-style property for a visual example of each outline
style.
• Outlines may not present themselves as boxes, as borders tend to do, because they
may wrap irregularly shaped elements; see the entry for outline for a visual
example of this.

outline-width
This property defines a width for an element’s outline.

Syntax
outline-width: length | medium | thick | thin | inherit

Like border-width, this property’s values can be keywords (thin, medium, or thick) and
numerical lengths such as pixels (px), inches (in), and so on.

Examples
p
{outline-style: dashed; outline-width: thick;}
.test {outline-width: 10px; outline-style: solid; outline-color: black;}

Notes
• Older Firefox- and Mozilla-based browsers like Netscape 6+ could set this value
using a proprietary property –moz-outline-width.
• As described in the entry for outline, when setting outline-width the outline
should not take up canvas space and may overlap other elements.

overflow
This property determines an element’s behavior when its content doesn’t fit into the space
defined by the element’s other properties.

Syntax
overflow:

auto | hidden | scroll | visible | inherit

By default, content will be visible, but a value of hidden will clip content that extends past
the defined region size. A value of scroll adds scroll bars appropriately so that content

Chapter 5:

can be viewed. A value of auto allows the user agent to decide how to handle content
that overflows. The following illustration should make the meaning of the values clear:

where each padding value is either a length, percentage, auto, or inherit value. As a
shorthand form, it is possible to set the four padding values (padding-top, padding-right,
padding-bottom, and padding-left) independently with this property:
margin
border
1 padding-top

Content

padding-right

2

4
padding-left

592

3 padding-bottom

The padding shorthand property is similar to margin. A single value creates equal
padding on all sides. Up to four values can be used, in the following clockwise order:
padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left. Any missing value
defaults to the value defined for the side opposite to it. However, unlike the margin
property, the padding property cannot take negative values.

Examples
#div1 {border-style: solid; padding: 10px 20px 10px 5px;}
/* all sides different */
#div2 {border-style: dashed; padding: 50px;}
/* padding of 50px on all sides */

position
This property defines how an element is positioned relative to other elements.

Syntax
position: absolute | fixed | relative | static | inherit

When positioned absolute, the left, right, top, and bottom properties can be used to
define the element’s precise location, using the affected element’s upper-left corner (0,0) as
reference. Because elements can contain other elements, a position of 0,0 is not necessarily
the upper-left corner of the browser. When a relative position is used, offsets will be
related to the object’s natural position in the document flow. An element with absolute
position may be set to defined coordinates but will scroll with a window. However, an
object with a fixed position value will stay in position onscreen as things scroll.

Chapter 5:

CSS Syntax and Property Reference

597

The default value, static, places elements according to the natural order in which they
occur in a document, and related top, right, left, and bottom properties do not relate.

Examples
#region1
#region2
#left
#norm
#navbar

{position: relative; left: 190px; top: 30px;}

quotes
This property defines the style of quotation marks to be used with embedded quotations.

Syntax
quotes: quote-pair1 ... quote-pairN | none | inherit

where each quote-pair is a set of two strings, the first for the open quote value and the
second for the close quote value. Having more than one quote-pair allows developers to
specify different quote symbols for each level of nesting. A value of none produces no
quotation marks.

Examples
blockquote {quotes : '<' '>';}
q {quotes: none;}
p.example q {quotes: '[' ']' '<' '>';}

right
This property defines the x (horizontal) coordinate for a positioned element, relative to the
right side of either the containing element or browser window if directly within the <body>.

Syntax
right: length | percentage | auto | inherit

where length can be specified in the standard units of length, such as inches (in) and so on,
but is nearly always set in pixels (px), and percentage corresponds to a percentage of the
containing object’s dimensions. The default value auto lets this property function as
placing the object where it normally would fall in the document flow. For relative position,
this will likely be treated as 0. For absolute and fixed positioning, it will calculate a value
based upon other set properties, particularly left.

Examples
#div1 {position: absolute; right: 100px; top: 150px;}
#div2 {position: absolute; right: 50%; bottom: 30%;}

This property controls the algorithm used to lay out the table cells, rows, and columns.

Syntax
table-layout: auto | fixed | inherit

A value of fixed uses the fixed table layout algorithm, which relays not the content of the
cells but simply the width of the tables, columns, borders, and defined cell spacing. This
should result in faster page rendering. The default value of auto uses the standard automatic
table layout algorithm, which may require multiple passes or take perceptible time to calculate,
particularly when the table is complex or heavily nested.

Examples
table.fast {table-layout: fixed;}
table.slow {table-layout: auto;}

text-align
This property sets the horizontal alignment of elements.

Syntax
text-align: center | justify | left | right | inherit

Examples
.goleft
{text-align: left;}
p.just
{text-align: justify;}
h1.centered {text-align: center;}

Compatibility
CSS 1, 2, 3

IE 3, 4 (no justify), 5+ Netscape 4 (quirky), 6+, Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• The default value for the property will depend on language reading direction, so
left when it is left to right and right when it is right to left.
• This property is similar to the align attribute available with (X)HTML block-level
tags such as <p>.
• Justification may produce poor results, showing whitespace “rivers” in large text
bodies because of screen resizing.

text-decoration
This property defines or even removes various inline text effects.

Syntax
text-decoration: blink | inherit | line-through | none | overline | underline

where line-through presents affected text as struck-thru, overline as text with a line
over it, underline as underlined text, and blink (when supported by a browser) blinks
the text. A value of inherit will derive this property value from an enclosing element,
while a value of none will override it.

Example
a
{text-decoration: none;}
a:visited {text-decoration: line-through;}
a:hover
{text-decoration: underline;}

PART II

where the keyword values align the text of an element appropriately left, right or center.
A value of justify will justify text on left or right side depending on document reading
direction. A value of inherit will derive this property value from an enclosing parent.

Compatibility
CSS 1, 2

IE 4+

Netscape 4+ (incomplete),
Netscape 6+ (complete), Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• Many user agents choose not to support the blink value for this property. Action is
to present the text normally. At the time of this writing, IE browsers (8 or less) and
Safari browsers (3 or less) do not support the blink value.
• The text-decoration property is often used with the a element and its associated
pseudo-classes (a:active, a:hover, a:link, and a:visited) to turn off link
underlining or set different looks for hover or visited states. Page authors concerned
about accessibility should be careful to provide alternate indicators such as position
or style if underlines are removed.

text-indent
This property specifies the indent in the first line of a block-level element.

Syntax
text-indent: length | percentage | inherit

where length is a standard length unit (10px), a percentage is a percentage value relative to
the enclosing element, and inherit derives the value of the property from some parent
element.

Examples
p
.bigDent
.negDent
#section1

{text-indent: .5em;}
{text-indent: 50px;}
{text-indent: -20px;}
{text-indent: 15%;}

Compatibility
CSS 1, 2, 3

IE 3+

Netscape 4+, Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• This property applies to block elements, table cells, and inline block types.
• The default value is 0, which indicates no indentation.

text-transform
This property transforms the case of the affected text.

Chapter 5:

CSS Syntax and Property Reference

601

Syntax
text-transform: capitalize | lowercase | none | uppercase

A value of capitalize will uppercase the initial letter of every space separated word in
the element applied to, while lowercase and uppercase will force all affected letters
correspondingly. A value of none will override any text-transform values that may be
inherited, leaving the text as written in the markup.

Examples

PART II

h1
{text-transform: capitalize;}
h1.nocap
{text-transform: none;}
.allsmall
{text-transform: lowercase;}
#bigletters {text-transform: uppercase; font-size: larger;}

Compatibility
CSS 1, 2, 3

IE 4+

Netscape 4 (incomplete for Mac), 4.5+, Firefox 1+

Opera 6+, Safari 1+

Note
• The value of none is used to override any inherited text-transform values.

top
This property defines the y (vertical) coordinate for a positioned element, relative to the top
of the enclosing object or browser window.

Syntax
top: length | percentage | auto | inherit

where length can be specified in the standard units of length, such as inches (in) and so on,
but is nearly always set in pixels (px), and percentage corresponds to a percentage of the
containing object’s dimensions. The default value auto lets this property function as
placing the object where it normally would fall in the document flow. For relative position,
this will likely be treated as 0. For absolute and fixed positioning, it will calculate a value
based upon other set properties, particularly bottom.

Examples
#div1 {position: absolute; left: 100px; top: 150px;}
#div2 {position: absolute; left: 50%; top: 30%;}
#div3 {position: absolute; left: 10px; bottom: 5px; top: auto;}
/* top will evaluate to a position calculated off the bottom position */
#navBar {position: fixed; left: 0; top: 0;}

Note
• Browsers tend to assume pixel measurements if a length unit is not set.

unicode-bidi
This property allows the text direction to be overridden to support multiple languages and
text flow directions in the same document.

Syntax
unicode-bidi: bidi-override | embed | normal| inherit

The value normal uses the standard direction and rendering. A value of embed allows a
new level of embedding to change direction, while bidi-override allows the direction
property to override any predefined direction.

Example
<div>I was normal and suddenly <span style="unicode-bidi: embed;
direction: rtl; background-color: yellow;">here doing I am What!</span>
This is the end of the test.</div>

Compatibility
CSS 2, 3

IE 4+

Netscape 6+, Firefox 1+

Opera 6+, Safari 1+

Note
• Unicode may limit 61 levels of embedding, so do not nest embed elements deeply.

vertical-align
This property sets the vertical positioning of text and images with respect to the baseline
setting.

Syntax
vertical-align: baseline | bottom | middle | sub | super | text-bottom |
text-top | top | percentage | length | inherit

A value of top aligns the top of text or images with the top of the tallest element, relative to
the baseline. A value of text-top aligns the top of text or images with the top of the font in
the containing element, while text-bottom aligns things with the bottom of the font. A
value of middle aligns the middle of text or images to the middle of the x-height of the
containing element. A value of bottom aligns the bottom of text or images with the bottom of
the lowest element, relative to the baseline. The sub and super values provide subscript and
superscript style. Positive and negative percentages and length values can be used, with
positive values raising the text and negative values lowering the text relative to the baseline.
The default value is baseline, which is also equivalent to 0 or 0%.

Chapter 5:

CSS Syntax and Property Reference

603

Examples
p
{vertical-align: top;}
.dive {vertical-align: sub;}
.climb {vertical-align: super;}
#bump {vertical-align: 10%;}
#lower {vertical-align: -1em;}

Compatibility
CSS 1, 2, 3

IE 4, 5 (problems), 5.5+

Netscape 4 (poor support),
Netscape 6+, Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

• Even when properly supported in browsers, vertical alignment changes will
potentially bump lines above or below the baseline, causing potentially undesirable
formatting changes.

visibility
This property determines whether or not an element is visible.

Syntax
visibility: collapse | hidden | inherit | visible

Examples
p
.invisible
.visible

{visibility: inherit;}
{visibility: hidden;}
{visibility: visible;}

Compatibility
CSS 2, 3

IE 4+

Netscape 4+, Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• The default value of inherit specifies that the visibility state is inherited from the
containing parent.
• This property is not the same as display: none as it simply makes the item invisible;
it does not completely remove it from the display canvas. The following example
demonstrates this:

PART II

Note

604

Part II:

Core Style

However, this distinction may not matter when an appropriate z-index value has made
the hidden object.
• This property is commonly used with JavaScript to show/hide an element or
perform certain dynamic effects.
• The CSS2 specification introduced the collapse value for this property for use
with table rows and columns to collapse cells. When the value is used on other
elements it should act like the value of hidden.

white-space
This property controls how spaces, tabs, and newline characters are handled in an element.

Syntax
white-space: normal | pre | nowrap | pre-wrap | pre-line | inherit

The normal value collapses multiple whitespace characters into single spaces and
automatically wraps lines, as in normal HTML/XHTML. The pre value makes the element
act much like a <pre> tag and preserves all white space. The value of nowrap prevents lines
from wrapping if they exceed the element’s content width. The value of pre-line collapses
white space, save newlines, which are preserved. The value of pre-wrap breaks newlines
that would cause text to break out of an element’s box; otherwise, it acts like a pre value.

Examples
p
{white-space: pre;}
pre
{white-space: normal;} /* change pre a bad idea */
.sourcecode {white-space: nowrap;}
.lovereturns {white-space: pre-line;}

Compatibility
CSS 1, 2, 3

IE 4+

Netscape 4+ (partial), Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Note
• The values of pre-wrap and pre-line are not supported in older browsers.

widows
This property defines the minimum number of lines in a paragraph to be left at the top of
a page.

Syntax
widows: integer | inherit

Chapter 5:

605

Examples
#hatewidows
.widowmaker

{widows: 5;}
{widows: 1;}

Compatibility
CSS 2, 3

IE 8+

Netscape 6+, Firefox 1+

Opera 7+, Safari 1+

Notes

• The default value should be 2 if unspecified.
• Negative values may not be used.

width
This property sets the width of an element’s content region (excluding padding, border,
and margin).

Syntax
width: length | percentage | auto | inherit

Standard positive length units can be used, and pixels (px) is often the assumed measurement
in browsers. Percentage values, based on the width of the containing element, can also be
used. The default value of auto automatically calculates the width of an element, based on
the width of the containing element and the size of the content.

Examples
p
{width: 400px; padding: 10px; border: solid 5px;}
#div1 {width: 80%; padding: 10px; border: solid 5px;}

Compatibility
CSS 1, 2, 3

IE 4+

Netscape 4+, Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• The actual size of an object on a browser canvas is not solely defined by the width
property, as values for borders and padding affect the space taken. For example,
given the CSS rule here
#div1 {width: 200px; padding: 30px; border: solid 20px;}

PART II

• This property is really only meaningful in a paged environment, such as print
output.

word-spacing
This property sets the spacing between words.

Syntax
word-spacing: length | normal | inherit

Length values can be set in any allowed measurement like inches (in), centimeters (cm),
millimeters (mm), points (pt), picas (pc), em spaces (em), or pixels (px). Negative values are
possible with this property, and may be used for interesting typographical effects. The default
value of normal sets word spacing to the standard browser setting.

Examples
p
p.normal
.carson

{font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt; word-spacing: 3pt;}
{font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt; word-spacing: normal;}
{word-spacing: -5px;}

z-index
This property defines a layering or stacking context for positioned elements.

Syntax
z-index: integer | auto | inherit

Examples
#div1 {position: absolute; top: 20px; left: 20px; height: 50px; width: 50px;
background-color: blue; z-index: 2;}
#stayDown {z-index: -10;}

Compatibility
CSS 2, 3

IE 4+

Netscape 4+, Firefox 1+

Opera 4+, Safari 1+

Notes
• When nesting objects are nested position-wise, note that each individual positioned
box maintains its own stacking context, with 0 being the default z-index level.
• It is a wise idea not to use contiguous z-index values, so that it is easy to insert
between objects.

CSS2 and CSS 2.1 Aural Style Properties
CSS2 specified a number of properties for use with speech-based browsers. CSS 2.1
retained these but, so far, no major browsers currently support these properties natively.
Furthermore, the specification actually indicates that user agents “...are not required to
implement the properties of this chapter in order to conform to CSS 2.1.” Because of
this and the lack of the support, this section provides only basic information on these
properties, but note that in the case of speech-enabled browsers, the properties provide
improvements to specify the rate of speech, time to pause before and after words, how
background sounds should be controlled, and much more. Table 5-10 lists the CSS2 aural
style properties and provides the most basic details.

PART II

By default, overlapping positioned elements stack in the order in which they are defined in
a markup document. This property can override default layering by assigning numeric
layering values to an element, with higher numbers layering above lower numbers. Negative
numbers are allowed. The auto value tries to determine the z-placement of an element
automatically by its markup position in the document.

TIP More details on these properties can be found at www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/aural.html.
TIP While aural properties may seem to have little use in visual presentation, some CSS authors like
to use aural style sheet rules to confuse certain browser versions to overload properties, such as
what the Box Model hack does. This technique is not suggested and scripting logic should be
used instead.

CSS3 has also taken up the cause of aural style sheets with its Speech module
(www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/). It introduces new values to improve pronunciation, like
phonemes, but also seems to simply rename features; for example, stress becomes
voice-stress, pitch becomes voice-pitch, and volume becomes voice-volume. The
only browsers that have any sense of support for this are experimental versions of Opera
on Windows, and here you may require a -xv- prefix; for example, –xv-voice-stress
instead of voice-stress.
The renaming effort regardless of prefix seems only helpful in the few places where
aural terms might be ambiguous when mixed with other presentation. However, given how
little speech-browsing technology exists, and noting that which does exist often ignores
aural-focused CSS properties, looking even further ahead to CSS3 might seem to be a bit of
a waste of time.

CHAPTER

CSS3 Proprietary and
Emerging Features Reference

T

his chapter aims to provide a complete reference for the emerging CSS3 and
proprietary CSS properties supported in modern browsers. However, given the
constant flux in CSS property support and the continued introduction of new
features, readers are duly warned to use this material as a jumping off point to explore the
latest styling features.

The State of CSS3
CSS3 is a sprawling specification that attempts to modularize CSS and both extend and improve
on previous CSS versions. Grandiose is the plan, but the reality at the time of this edition’s
writing is that CSS3 is filled with half-started and apparently abandoned specifications, with no
updates for years or even nearly a decade, intermixed with lively and active modules.
Web professionals looking to make a determination of what to pay attention to in the
future of CSS3 are likely put off by the list of various components found at www.w3.org/
Style/CSS/current-work#CSS3. For all the downsides of having one large specification like
HTML5, at least there is an entry point that is obvious. To provide an overview, Table 6-1
summarizes the CSS3 modules with specifications (as of this edition’s publication) and
provides a brief description of each.
A snapshot specification circa 2007 (www.w3.org/TR/css-beijing) suggested that some
of these modules are more important than others and that browsers should support all of
CSS 2.1, including errata CSS3 selectors, CSS3 colors, and CSS namespaces. We look at these
and a few of the larger syntax changes next before detailing the various new properties that
have been implemented by browsers.

CSS3 Selectors
CSS3 has gone somewhat overboard with its introduction of new selectors, making selector
syntax at times potentially quite confusing, particularly when chained excessively. Table 6-2
summarizes the selector syntax from the CSS3 Selector Specification that is different from
CSS1 and 2.1 selector syntax. The standard CSS1 and 2 selectors are not repeated here
because the focus is solely on what is different in CSS3.

CSS3 Selectors (continued)

Emerging CSS3 Selectors

CSS3 also defines a number of form element–focused selectors outside of the core selector
specification. At the time of this edition’s writing, some of these features have been partially
implemented in Firefox 3.x and Opera 10 browsers, and it’s likely others will follow soon.
The specification for these features is far from set as they rely on HTML5 form element
syntax, which is still in flux, so the primary selectors summarized in Table 6-3 should serve
as only an introduction to the syntax. Check the book’s support site or the particular
standard in question for the latest information.
It is interesting to see that many JavaScript libraries were the first places to implement
CSS3 selector syntax to make it easy to filter a document’s DOM tree for interesting nodes.
It’s been the author’s experience that, so far, most Web developers learn some of the
advanced selectors through JavaScript rather than in CSS, but hopefully over time that will
change as these selectors become supported by all browsers.

Applies styles to elements that
are optional (not required to be
addressed before submission) as
defined by all elements without the
HTML5 required attribute set.
Used to select interactive elements
whose values are outside the range
specified by the HTML5 min and

Used to select elements that are
read-only. When applied to form
elements, this would select fields
with the readonly attribute set.
Used to select elements that
are possible to read and write.
While this would apply to all
form elements, considered
with the emerging use of
contenteditable this suggests
this selector may have value beyond
form fields.
Applies styles to elements that are
required (must be addressed before

Measurement

622

Part II:

Core Style

NOTE A few CSS3 units that have been discussed online, such as grid units (gr or gd), fractions

(fr), and turns, are not presented in Table 6-4 either because there is a lack of documentation or
because there is a clear indication of instability of these values.

CSS3 also introduces a calc() function that can be used wherever length values are
allowed. The function is used to calculate a value using some basic mathematics. For example,
p {margin: calc(1rem-2px) calc(1.5rem-5px);}

would set the margins of the paragraph based upon the root element’s font minus some
small pixel value. Browser support for this measurement is nonexistent, and it is interesting
to see that it is similar to Microsoft’s CSS expressions, which have been maligned and later
disabled in the IE browser in some versions and settings due to performance considerations.

CSS3 Color Values
The CSS3 Color module defines the color units supported in CSS and documents a few
color properties, most notably color and opacity. The specification also introduces a few
new color units and keywords, as summarized in Table 6-5.
CSS3 Color
Feature

Description

currentColor Can be used as a macro for
keyword
whatever the current color
is. This is useful if you want
to dynamically change one
color and have other related
colors change.
HSL Color
CSS3 introduces Hue
Saturation Lightness (HSL),
where color values are
specified as hsl(hue,
saturation,lightness).
Hue is set as the degree on
the color wheel, where 0 or
360 if you wrap around is
red, 120 is green, and 240
is blue, with the various
other colors found between.
Saturation is a percentage
value, with 100% being
the fully saturated color.
Lightness is a percentage,
with 0% being dark and 100%
light with the average 50%
being the norm.

Description

Example(s)

Support

CSS3 HSL value with a
fourth value to set the
alpha channel value for the
color to define the opacity
of the element. An HSLa is
specified via a function style
hsla(hue,saturation,
lightness, alpha),
where hue, saturation, and
lightness are the same as
standard hsl() values, and
the alpha channel value for
defining opacity is a number
between 0 (fully transparent)
and 1 (fully opaque).
Like RGB color but adds
an alpha channel value
to specify the opacity
of the color. An RGBa is
specified via a function style
rgba(r,g,b,a) value,
where colors r, g, and b
are specified as a decimal
value from 0 to 255 or a
percentage from 0 to 100%,
and the alpha channel
value for defining opacity is
a number between 0 (fully
transparent) and 1 (fully
opaque). Values outside this
range will be rounded up or
down to fit the closest value.
CSS3 defines the color
property to accept the
keyword transparent,
which is just a shorthand for
a value of rgba(0,0,0,0).

#bluetrans {
color:
hsla(240,100%,50%,0.5);}

CSS3 Proprietary and Emerging Features Reference

624

Part II:

Core Style

Obviously, if there is a concern about using CSS3 color values, a hex value should be
used instead. A simple trick can be employed, however, in the situation where simply the
opacity is not supported but the standard color value is; just use the cascade aspect of CSS
to start with a known supported value and then follow it with the newer color format for
supporting browsers:
#greentest {color:rgb(0,255,0);
color:rgba(0,255,0,0.4);}

As the current specification is written, little is introduced by this CSS3 module. Most
modern browsers, save Internet Explorer 8, support these features.

NOTE The specification also clearly codifies in one place many of the various color values from
various specifications. See Appendix C for an overview of color values.

Namespaces
In XHTML and XML, it is possible to intermix markup languages in a single document.
When using mixed vocabularies, it is possible to have tags that have similar names but are
from different vocabularies. Commonly, an example is given of having the traditional
HTML tag <table> being confused with some <table> tag in a fictitious Furniture
Markup Language. Adding the concept of a namespace to indicate what vocabulary a tag
comes from eliminates confusion, but this would have to be extended to CSS. For example,
using our <table> tag example, what would the following rule do?
table {border: 1px solid red;}

Would it apply the rule to both types of tags or just one. What about if we wanted to
introduce a different look for each? Enter the CSS3 @namespace directive. As an example,
here we introduce a CSS rule for a standard <p> tag and one for a <p> tag in our custom
namespace:
<style type="text/css">
p {color: red;}
</style>
<style type="text/css">
@namespace "htmlref";
p {background-color: green; color: white;}
</style>

Then, depending on syntax, we might have
<p>This is a standard p tag and <p xmlns="htmlref">a named spaced
p tag</p> and back to normal.</p>

When we can invoke an XML parser, the browser should apply different styles to the
differently namespaced tags:

Chapter 6:

CSS3 Proprietary and Emerging Features Reference

625

Interestingly, the support for this construct is most problematic due to browser handling of
XML/XHTML documents, MIME types, and the varying syntaxes for mixing tag
vocabularies.

NOTE This demo uses an xmlns attribute, which is discussed in the HTML5 specification

Media Queries
A media query takes the CSS media attribute and extends it with conditions. For example,
commonly Web developers are familiar with a style rule for print and one for screen. Media
queries add to this a query upon the media, such as what is the available width or color, to
then determine whether to apply rules or not. Such a query system allows Web developers
to easily apply different styles to different conditions, such as one style for a wide screen
and one for a narrow one, without resorting to JavaScript. As an example, here we employ a
style sheet wide.css if the screen resolution is at least 1024px, a different one for a midrange
window size, and one for a small window size:
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 1024px)" href="wide.
css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 641px) and (max-width:
1023px)" href="medium.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 640px)" href="narrow.
css">

Interestingly, most modern browsers, with the exception of Internet Explorer as of
version 8, support this, as shown in Figure 6-1.

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/ch6/mediaquery.html
Media queries can be used inline, as well, with the @media syntax, and may also apply
to different mediums; for example, here we might apply different CSS rules depending on
the print style:
@media print and (orientation:portrait) { /* portrait layout rules */ }
@media print and (orientation:landscape) { /* landscape rules */ }

Table 6-6 details all of the media queries defined by the specification, though
implementations currently focus mostly on width-related features.
What you decide to do with a media query is up to your imagination. An interesting
possibility is side-by-side display environments for wide monitors and stacked layouts for
narrow ones.

Web Fonts
An exciting change that some incorrectly think was introduced by CSS3 is the inclusion of
Web fonts. In reality, downloadable fonts using CSS and even HTML have been available in
browsers since the 4.x generation, though with the demise of Netscape, only Internet
Explorer continued to support them until their later reintroduction in more modern
browsers. Regardless of their origin, the syntax is fairly consistent. An “at” (@) rule is used
to associate a font name to be used in a style sheet with some downloadable font. A fontfamily property is used within the rule to name the font, and an src is associated with an
external font name:
@font-face {font-family: fontname;

src: url(fontfile);}

Later, the font can be used as a name within properties like font-family and font.
Make sure to specify other font names as a fallback in case downloadable font technology is
not supported or the font fails to load for some reason. As an example:
@font-face {font-family: "handwriting"; src: url(handwriting.ttf);}
body {font-family: "handwriting", cursive; font-size: 5em;}

It is also possible to set selection of a particular downloadable font when a particular font
characteristic like bold or italic is set by adding the corresponding rule to the @font-face rule:
@font-face {font-family: "Mufferaw"; src: url(MUFFERAW.ttf);}
@font-face {font-family: "Mufferaw"; src: url(MUFFERAWBOLD.ttf);
font-weight: bold;}
p {font-family: "Mufferaw", serif; font-size: 5em;}
em {font-weight: bold;} /* would specify the mufferawbold font */

There are even more characteristics that can be set, including what character sets are
supported, but so far quirks abound even in basic syntax. Readers are particularly warned

that technologies for downloadable fonts vary significantly between browsers. Appendix B
discusses some approaches to using custom fonts online.

Miscellaneous CSS3 Changes

body {background: white url(donkey.gif) top left no-repeat,
url(elephant.gif) bottom right no-repeat;}

This would also work on the background-image property, of course, given
background is just a shorthand for all background characteristics. So we see that once you
can specify multiple background images, this ripples through numerous properties like

background-position. For example, when using background-position on different

backgrounds, we apply the position to each background in order, so
background-position: 50px 100px, 200px 200px;

would position the first background at 50px, 100px and the second background at 200px,
200px. Similarly, other background properties like background-repeat would change in
a similar manner, so
background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat-x;

would apply no-repeat to the first background and repeat-x to the second.
The CSS3 background changes are supported at the time of this edition’s writing at least
in WebKit-based browsers. We focus in this chapter mostly on those areas of CSS3 where we
have a close-to-final specification (for example, Selectors) or have some implementation to
reference. While we have some good sense about what CSS3 features are likely to be
supported by browsers, it makes little sense to speculate too much until it is something
implemented and actually used by a Web developer or designer.

Implemented CSS3 and Browser-Specific Features
The CSS3 specification is far from complete, numerous aspects of the various proposed
modules that make up the specification have not been worked on for years, and there are
clearly many holes. However, browser vendors have implemented a number of properties
already. Further, many browser vendors have introduced proprietary extensions to CSS,
some of which have then been added to the CSS specification and some of which haven’t.

PART II

One of the things about CSS3 that may surprise developers is that it makes subtle changes
in a number of places rather than introducing all new properties. We see many new list-type
values like arabic, binary, lower hexadecimal, mongolian, thai, ethiopic, hangul,
norwegian, somali, and many more. Many more cursor values are introduced for more
application-style Web development like alias, context-menu, and not-allowed. A full
list can be found in the cursor property entry in the previous chapter.
Where possible, we alluded to these more subtle changes in the previous chapter’s
reference when they were supported by browsers. Though, without looking at all entries
globally, you might not see how some CSS3 changes have wide effect. For example, CSS3compliant browsers should support multiple backgrounds. Here, we specify different files
for the background, each separated with a comma:

Part II:

Core Style

This section details the properties that are supported in some major browsers shipping
circa late 2009. Each entry will present the following items:
• Brief summary
• Syntax summary
• Example(s) of use
• Compatibility information
• Notes and special considerations
The aim here is for completeness, but given the moving nature of emerging and
proprietary CSS features, readers are warned that this content may change or never be
widely adopted. Awareness of intent and presentation of basic syntax is the primary goal
here, as testing likely will be required to safely use these properties.

NOTE To provide for the best long-term accuracy, where possible and when clear, CSS3 syntax is

presented first. If a browser supports a property extension to emulate the CSS3 syntax, that will
be presented in the notes and examples. Not every possible browser extension is presented,
particularly those properties only implemented in a minor-market-share browser that have not
been defined at least partially in any known CSS3 module.

@keyframes
This CSS “at” rule is used to define the properties that will be animated in an animation rule.

Syntax
@keyframes: keyframe-name
{percentage | from | to {cssrules}}*

where each block starts with the percentage into the animation at which the rules apply,
from is a keyword for 0%, and to is a keyword for 100%.

Example
@-webkit-keyframes move {
from {
left: 0;
top: 0;
opacity: 1;
}
50% {
left: 500px;
top: 0;
opacity: 1;
}
to {
left: 500px;
top: 500px;
opacity: 1;
}}

accelerator
This property specifies whether an element is an accelerator indicator or not.

accelerator: true | false

When the standard underline style is applied and accelerator is set to true, the style
should be toggled when the ALT key is depressed, revealing the various access keys in play.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>

animation
This shorthand property is used to set all of the animation properties at once.

Syntax
animation: animation-name animation-duration animation-timing-function
animation-delay animation-iteration-count animation-direction

where each value is defined by its named property. Like other shorthand properties, values
may be omitted. There may be other shorthand animation rules that follow the first,
separated by commas.

• Firefox 3.7 pre-releases show support for CSS transitions which are very related to
CSS animation. It is quite likely that a form of this property using the –moz prefix
may be supported in a Firefox browser by the time you read this.

This property is used to define a delay before an animation starts.

Syntax
animation-delay: time1 [,..timeN]

where time is a standard CSS time value like 2s or 4700ms. The default value is 0, meaning
the animation starts immediately.

animation-direction
This property is used to indicate if an animation plays in reverse or repeats itself every
other iteration.

Syntax

animation-duration
This property is used to define the time it takes one iteration of an animation to play.

Syntax
animation-duration: time [,time]*

where time is a valid time value like 5s or 3500ms. The initial value of time is 0, meaning no
animation plays.

backface-visibility
This property is used to indicate whether the backside of an element is visible if the element
is rotated to display the back.

Syntax
backface-visibility: hidden | visible

The default value is visible. When it is set to hidden, the element is not visible if it is not
facing the screen. When it is set to visible, it is always visible, which may mean you see
the reverse of an image.

background-clip
This property specifies whether or not an element’s background extends all the way to the
element’s border.

Syntax
background-clip: border | padding [, border | padding,..]

• WebKit-based browsers have experimented with a value of text for their –webkitbackground-clip property to create a clip outline for text to create an interesting
punch-out effect.

background-origin
This property specifies how the position of a background should be calculated by setting
the origin relative to different locations within an element’s box.

Syntax
background-origin: border | padding | content [, border | padding |
content,...]

where the default is padding, causing the position of the background to be relative to the
outside of the padding or, more obviously, the start of the border. It also can be set relative
to the outside of the border or the start of the content. The effect of this property is quite
noticeable when looking at a positioned background where borders with transparent
regions are used:

behavior
This Microsoft-proposed CSS property is used to define the URL for a script providing
DHTML behavior. It is similar in purpose and function to the CSS3 binding property.

Syntax
behavior: url(default behavior name or URL of behavior)

Microsoft has implemented a number of default behaviors. These are accessible by
specifying the url as #default#behaviorname, such as behavior:url(#default#
clientCaps);. Once these behaviors are associated with an element, additional properties
will be available to that element based on the default behavior used. Table 6-7 shows a
summary of the common default behaviors supported by Internet Explorer browsers.

Notes
• Starting with IE 8 this property is properly written as –ms-behavior because it is
an extension.
• Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox support a similar concept using the
–moz-binding property.

• A more complete discussion of behaviors, and built-in Internet Explorer behaviors
in particular, can be found at the MSDN site online (http://msdn.microsoft.com),
but you should note that, for security concerns, some behaviors have been removed
or modified over time.
• Behaviors are often bound to made-up elements when used, but this is not required.

binding
This property defines a relationship between bound elements(s) and some code or content.
Generally, it is used to associate some scripting to various elements in a document.

binding: none | url(bindingfile)

where bindingfile is some technology such as XBL to add content or associate markup with
script code.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>behavior and binding Example</title>
<style type="text/css">
#clickable {behavior: url(hello.htc); -moz-binding: url(hello.xml);
binding: url(hello.xml);}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Just a regular paragraph.</p>
<p id="clickable">I'm special click me.</p>
<p>Just a regular paragraph.</p>

border-image
This property defines an image to be used for the border of the element.

Syntax
border-image: none | url(image) imagesection [/imagewidth] imagehandling

where imagesection defines the portions of the image that are used for various parts of the
border. The imagesection value can be composed of up to four slice lines on the image, each
measured in pixels or percentages, as shown in this diagram:
Slice 4
Slice 1

The first cutline is across the top and defines the height of the top-left and top-right
corners; the second cutline defines the width of the top-right and bottom-right corners; the
third cutline defines the height of the bottom corners; and the fourth cutline defines the
width of the left corners, top and bottom. For example, given
url(background-image)

50px 20px 100px 30px

you would set cuts like this:
50px

100px

30px

20px

A / allows for the specification of image widths for each of the borders from top, right,
bottom, and left. Widths are generally in length units, such as pixels. Finally, three
keywords as defined above as imagehandling can be placed to control whether the middle
zones of the cutlines are to be stretched (stretch), repeated (repeat), or shown to the
nearest whole image (round). For example, given this image

the differences between a repeatable as opposed to a stretched border image should be clear:

Example
<div style="-moz-border-image: url(starborder.png) 50px 50px 50px 50px
stretch stretch;
-webkit-border-image: url(starborder.png) 50px 50px 50px 50px

Notes
• In Mozilla-based browsers like Firefox this property is –moz-border-image and in
WebKit-based browsers like Chrome or Safari it is –webkit-border-image.
• The border image will tile over the center of the image as well, but if you make it
transparent, you can have a background image or color show as well.
• The border image will cover a defined standard border, so it is useful to have a
fallback in case browsers do not support this emerging property.

border-radius
This property is used to round border corners.

Syntax
border-radius: horizontal-radius vertical-radius

where the radius values are set as lengths. A single length value defines the radius of all
corners, or each can be specified one by one from top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and
finally bottom-left.

Examples
<div style="border: 1px solid red;-moz-border-radius: 15px;-webkit-borderradius: 15px;border-radius: 15px;">

Notes
• Mozilla-based browsers like Firefox define this property as –moz-border-radius
while WebKit-based browsers like Chrome and Safari define it as –webkitborder-radius.
• There is a definition in the CSS3 specification on a second set of radius values being
applied to set vertical radius pair wise with horizontal radius. Currently, the
browsers do not support this well or, in most cases, at all, and actually provide
documentation that contradicts the specification. Clearly, this is a work in progress.
• The individual corners can be specified individually using their own properties, as
shown in subsequent listings. While the CSS3 specification defines properties like
border-top-right-radius, there are syntax differences in early supporting
browsers, with Mozilla-based browsers supporting a syntax like -moz-borderradius-topright and WebKit-based browsers supporting -webkit-bordertop-right-radius.

• When background images are employed, we should expect clipping to the curved
corner as shown next, but this is not consistently implemented in browsers yet:

box-reflect
This property specifies the size of the mask.

Syntax
-webkit-box-reflect: direction offset mask-box-image

where direction can be above, right, below, or left and indicates where the reflection

box-shadow
This property sets the shadow for a box element.

Syntax
box-shadow: shadow1 [,...shadowN] | none | inherit

where each shadow is defined as
color x-offset y-offset blur-radius spread-radius

where color is the color of the shadow. When unspecified, color may be set by the user agent or
inherited from the current color. The x-offset and y-offset define the shadow position relative
to the element, where positive numbers are to the right and down and negative numbers are
to the left and up, respectively. Setting these values to 0 puts the shadow directly behind the
element. The blur-radius defines the degree of blur, with larger numbers making the shadow
more blurry. The spread-radius defines the size of the shadow. A positive value makes the
shadow bigger than the object and a negative value makes it smaller than the element.
When unspecified, the spread-radius is 0, making the shadow the same size as the element.

box-sizing
This property changes the calculation for measuring the width of elements.

Syntax
box-sizing: border-box | content-box | inherit

The default content-box specifies that element size is defined by adding the border,
padding, and height/width together to define the size of the box, which is what is typically
seen in browsers. When set to border-box, a supporting browser will render the box by the
defined height and width properties, pulling the border and padding size from within the
box, similar to much older box model thinking.

#ex1 {-moz-box-sizing: border-box;
-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
box-sizing: border-box;

This property is used to control column element breaks after an associated element when
flowing multicolumn text.

Syntax
column-break-after: always | auto | avoid

A value of always should force a column break after the associated element. A value of
avoid attempts to avoid a column break after the element. The default value of auto
neither forces nor forbids a column break, allowing the user agent to decide how to break
the content during flow.

where filternames is one of the numerous filters shown in Table 6-8 or transitions shown in
Table 6-9. It is possible to have multiple filters. They need to be separated by a space. The
filters are processed in order. Always place transitions last.
Transitions are different from filters in that they toggle between two display blocks and
the transition needs to be activated. This is done through JavaScript by calling the Apply()
function on the filter, updating the object’s visibility, and then calling play() on the
filter. In this example, transition is the id of a div with image1 and image2 as children:
transition.filters[0].Apply();
image1.style.visibility = "hidden";
image2.style.visibility = "visible";
transition.filters[0].play();

Note that all transitions have the attributes duration, which is a number in seconds, and
enabled, which is true or false.

Notes
• Under IE 8 this property should be written as –ms-filter to show it is an
extension. You may have to use compatibility mode manually or via a header to
make filters and transitions work otherwise.
• When using the filter property for Internet Explorer, make sure that the object
has layout in the page which is usually accomplished by setting its size or position.
• A common use of filters that seems to be an acceptable hack to many Web developers
is the use of the alpha() filter to emulate the opacity property in Internet Explorer:
.opacity {opacity: 0.7; filter: alpha(opacity=70); zoom: 1;}

gradient
This function creates a CSS gradient image that can be used anywhere an image URL is
required, including background-image, border-image, and list-style properties.

Syntax
Linear Syntax:
gradient: linear, start_point, end_point, stop1 [...stopN]

Radial Syntax:
gradient: radial, inner_center, inner_radius, outer_center, outer_radius,
stop1 [...stopN]

The syntax shows the type can be linear or radial and will take slightly different values
in each case. When start_point, end_point, inner_center, and outer_center are
used, they will be a pair of values that can be a number, percentage, or the keywords top,
bottom, left, and right. The values inner_radius and outer_radius are numbers that
can be specified only if the type is radial. The values stop1 (to N) are placeholders for the
color-stop() function that indicates what the color should be at a given point in the
gradient. The function color-stop() takes two arguments, the first of which is a number
between 0 and 1.0 or a percentage indicating the location of the stop. The second argument
is the color at that stop as a standard CSS color value. The functions from(color-value)
and to(color-value) are shorthand for color-stop(0, color-value) and colorstop(1, color-value), respectively, and can be used instead.

Examples
<div style="height: 300px; width: 200px; padding: 20px;
border: 5px solid black;
background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom,
from(#f00), to(rgba(0,255,0,0)), color-stop(.5, #00f));" ></div>
<div style="height: 300px; width: 200px; padding: 20px;
border: 5px solid black;
background: -webkit-gradient(radial, 100 100, 20, 200 200, 50,
from(#ff0), to(rgba(255,0,255,0)), color-stop(25%, #f00));" ></div>

image-rendering
This property defines the resampling method to use when stretching images.

Syntax
image-rendering: auto | inherit | optimizeSpeed | optimizeQuality

where the default value auto uses a bilinear resampling scheme to provide high quality
with decent speed, a value of optimizeQuality emphasizes quality over speed, and
optimizeSpeed renders quickly with some loss of quality in the resample.

Examples
<!-- zoom in browser to see effect -->
<img src="star.png">

opacity
This property specifies the transparency of an element.

Syntax
opacity: alphavalue | inherit

where alphavalue is a number ranging from 0.0, fully transparent, to 1.0, fully opaque.

Examples
#tng {opacity: 0.8; background-color: blue;}
#invisible {opacity: 0;}
#blam {opacity: 1;}

Compatibility
CSS3

Chrome 1+, Firefox 1+, IE 4+ (using filter property), Opera 9+, Safari 1.2+

Note
• When using the filter property for Internet Explorer, make sure that the opaque
object that you will apply the effect to has layout, which is usually accomplished by
setting its size or position.

outline-offset
This property defines the offset from an element’s border and its outline.

Syntax
outline-offset: length | inherit

where length is any valid CSS length value used to move the outline away from the
element’s border. Negative values are supported and will put the outline within the
element’s border.

Chapter 6:

CSS3 Proprietary and Emerging Features Reference

691

Examples
#offset1 {outline: dashed 4px green; border: solid 10px red;
outline-offset: 15px;}
#offset2 {outline: dashed 4px green; border: solid 10px red;
outline-offset: -45px;}

Compatibility
CSS3

Firefox 1.5+, Opera 9.5+, Safari 1.2+

• Before Firefox 1.5, Mozilla browsers supported the equivalent –moz-outlineoffset property.

outline-radius
This property defines the rounding of the corners on an outline.

Syntax
outline-radius: lengths | inherit

where lengths is up to four valid CSS length or percentage values to round the corners of the
outline. When multiple values are used, they are applied starting with the top left and
proceeding to top right, bottom right, and finally bottom left. The values copy into the
locations opposite, similar to how margins and paddings are handled in CSS.

Examples
#radius1 {-moz-outline-radius: 20px;}
#radius2 {-moz-outline-radius: 20px 5px;}
#radius3 {-moz-outline-radius: 20px 60px 5px 45px;}

Compatibility
CSS3 speculative

Firefox 3+

Notes
• This property is alluded to in CSS3 discussions, though it is not currently
documented. The discussion here is based upon the current implementation in
Mozilla-based browsers, which support it as –moz-outline-radius.
• Mozilla browsers also define –moz-outline-radius-topleft, -moz-outlineradius-topright, -moz-outline-radius-bottomright, and –moz-outlineradius-bottomleft to set the corners individually.

overflow-style
This property allows a marquee to be used in the case of a text overflow.

Syntax
overflow-style: auto | marquee-block | marquee-line

PART II

Note

692

Part II:

Core Style

The initial value is auto, which allows the user agent to determine the scrolling effect. A
value of marquee-line employs horizontal scrolling, and a value of marquee-block
employs vertical scrolling. The particular directions left to right or up and down will
depend on the text direction in the document.

Example
<p style="overflow: auto;
overflow-x:-webkit-marquee;
display:-wap-marquee;
overflow-style: marquee-line;
width: 100px;">
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
</p>

Compatibility
CSS3

Chrome 1+, Opera 8+, Safari 2+

Notes
• In Safari, it is necessary to set an element’s overflow-x or overflow-y to
-webkit-marquee to activate marquee-style functionality.
• In Opera, it is necessary to set an element’s display to -wap-marquee to activate
marquee effects.

overflow-x
This property defines how content should behave when it exceeds the width of its enclosing
element.

Syntax
overflow-x: auto | hidden | scroll | visible

Example
<p style="overflow-x: scroll; width: 100px;">
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
</p>

Compatibility
CSS3

Chrome 2+, Firefox 1+, IE 4+, Opera 9.5+, Safari 3+

Notes
• This property is correctly written as –ms-overflow-x under IE 8 to show that it is
an extension.
• This is currently in the CSS3 specification and also supports values of no-display
and no-content.

Chapter 6:

overflow-y
This property defines how content should behave when it exceeds the height of its
enclosing element.

Syntax
overflow-y: auto | hidden | scroll | visible

Example

Compatibility
CSS3

Chrome 2+, Firefox 1+, IE 4+, Opera 9.5+

Notes
• This property is correctly written as –ms-overflow-y under IE 8 to indicate it as an
extension.
• This is currently in the CSS3 specification and also supports values of no-display
and no-content.
• Some Firefox versions put the scroll bar the wrong direction with this property.

perspective
This property is used to give a 3-D sense of depth to an element. Only the children of the
element are given the noted perspective, not the actual element itself.

Syntax
perspective: none | number

where number is set to the distance of the z=0 plane from the viewer. The default is none.

Examples
<div style="height:100px;width:180px;background-color:red;
-webkit-perspective:200;">Perspective set.<br><br>

Notes
• WebKit supports this property as –webkit-perspective, though it is currently
only available in the iPhone and the development builds of Safari 4+ on Macs.
• This property only works in conjunction with another transform because it alters
the way the other transform acts.

perspective-origin
This property is used to set the x and y origins for the –webkit-perspective property.

Syntax
perspective-origin: percentage | length | left | center | right [percentage |
length | top | center | bottom ]

where the default value is 50% 50%.

Example
<div style="height:200px;width:200px;background-color:red;
-webkit-perspective:200;-webkit-perspective-origin:right bottom;">
Perspective set.

resize
This CSS3 property is used to define whether an element should be resized and, if so, upon
what axis.

Syntax
resize: both | horizontal | none | vertical

Examples
<div style="height: 100px;width: 100px;margin: 100px;border: 1px solid
black;overflow: auto;resize: both;">Resize both ways</div>
<form action="#" method="get">

Part II:

Core Style

The visual presentation of how elements should be resized is not set, but so far it appears
that supporting browsers present a bottom-right resize corner indication.

Compatibility
CSS3

Chrome 3+, Safari 3+

Notes
• The property applies only to elements that do not have an overflow value of
visible. In general, this means that often you may set overflow: auto on
elements you wish to resize, as visible is the common value. Form fields, of
course, do not have that value and require no extra property.
• This property is commonly used on <textarea> tags.

ruby-align
This property defines the alignment of Ruby text as defined by a <rt> tag, in relation to
base text defined by a <ruby> tag.

Syntax
ruby-align: auto | center | distribute-letter | distribute-space | left |
line-edge | right

The default value of auto leaves it to the browser to align the Ruby text. A value of center
centers the Ruby text in the center of the text below if smaller or centers the reading guide
text above if larger. The distribute-letter and distribute-space values distribute the
reading guide text evenly across the text below, adding space in the case of distributespace. Values of left and right align the reading guide text above to the left or right when
it is smaller than the base text. A value of line-edge normally centers the reading guide text
unless the text is at the end of line where in that case it lines it up to the edge instead.

Examples
<p>123<ruby style="ruby-align: left;">日本語
<rp>(</rp><rt>にほんご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>456</p>
<p>123<ruby style="ruby-align: right;">日本語<rp>(</rp><rt>にほんご</
rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>456</p>

ruby-overhang
This property defines the overhang of Ruby text as defined by a <rt> tag, in relation to base
text defined by a <ruby> tag in regard to adjacent characters.

Syntax
ruby-overhang: auto | none | whitespace

Examples
<p>123<ruby style="ruby-overhang: whitespace;">

Example
<h1 style="font-size: 70px; -webkit-text-fill-color: red;">
Merry Christmas</h1>

Compatibility
No specification

Chrome 2+, Safari 3+

Notes
• Under WebKit-based browsers this property is defined as -webkit-text-fillcolor.
• This is often used in conjunction with text-stroke.

text-justify
This property provides greater control over how justified text should be aligned and spaced.

Syntax
text-justify: auto | distribute | distribute-all-lines | inter-cluster |
inter-ideograph | inter-word | kashida | newspaper

The default value of auto lets the browser define the justification algorithm to use. The
newspaper value changes the spacing between letters and words to justify. If you set
inter-word, it sets spacing solely between words. The value of distribute is similar to
newspaper but optimized for Asian languages. The value distribute-all-lines is the

to notice it in places and closely compare it to the same text without the property.

same as distribute though it also justifies the last line. A value of inter-cluster is used
to justify text that contains no interword spacing such as found in some Asian languages.
A value of inter-ideograph can justify lines of ideographic text dealing with spaces
between both ideograms and words.

Example
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: distribute-all-lines;
width: 250px;">
This paragraph is not only justified, but the text-justify property
is set to a value that makes the last line justify as well.
</p>

Compatibility
CSS3

IE 5+

Notes
• Under IE 8 this property is known as –ms-text-justify to correctly show it is
an extension.
• MSDN documentation presents a value of distribute-center-last as being
defined, though it indicates it is not implemented and does not say what it does.
However, it could be inferred from its name that it does the same thing as
distribute but centers the final line.
• The CSS3 Text module does support this property with a value of Tibetan as well.
There is considerable detail in the justification algorithms. Hopefully, this can be
correctly implemented in user agents, so justified text will become desirable because
of its’ improved readability and be more commonly used in Web documents.

text-kashida-space
This Microsoft-proposed CSS property defines the ratio between Kashida expansion and
whitespace expansion in justified text. Kashida is a typographic effect used with Arabic
writing systems to elongate characters during the justification process.

Syntax
text-kashida-space: percentage | inherit

Example
.whiteOnly {text-align: justify;
text-kashida-space: 0%;}
.stretchSome {text-align: justify; text-kashida-space: 50%;}
.stretchAll {text-kashida-space: 100%;}

Notes
• Under IE 8 this property is known as –ms-text-kashida-space to correctly show
it is an extension.
• There is brief allusion to this property in the CSS3 specification suggesting that it
may eventually end up in the CSS3 Text module.

text-overflow
This property defines whether or not an ellipsis should be displayed when content
overflows a region.

text-overflow: ellipsis | clip

Examples
p {width: 200px; border: 1px solid black;
overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap;
background-color: orange;}
.overflow {-ms-text-overflow: ellipsis;
-o-text-overflow: ellipsis;
-webkit-text-overflow: ellipsis;
text-overflow: ellipsis;}

Compatibility
CSS3 (see notes)

Chrome 2+, IE 6+, Opera 9+, Safari 3+

Notes
• For this property to work, the overflow property of the applied element should be
set to something other than visible.
• This property should be written as –ms-text-overflow under IE 8 as it is an
extension. It is supported as –o-text-overflow in Opera and –webkit-textoverflow in WebKit-based browsers.
• Some sites on the Web indicate –moz-text-overflow as supported but, as of
Firefox 3.5, documentation and testing reveals it is not. Interestingly, scripts exist
that try to implement the idea.
• The CSS3 specification suggests that this property is shorthand for textoverflow-ellipsis and text-overflow-mode. The current property acts as
text-overflow-mode, which sets how overflow should happen with an ellipsis.
The text-overflow-ellipsis property would be used to set the string or image
to be used as the overflow indicator. At the time of this edition’s writing, neither
property is supported and this portion of the specification is still in progress.

text-rendering
This SVG inherited property provides information to the browser about how text should be
rendered. Generally, it is used to specify a trade-off between performance and quality.

Syntax
text-rendering: auto | optimizeSpeed | optimizeLegibility |
geometricPrecision | inherit

The default value is auto. A value of optimizeSpeed tells the browser to focus on
rendering speed, a value of optimizeLegibility tells the browser to focus on text details
like kerning and ligatures to improve readability, and a value of geometricPrecision tells
the browser to focus on the geometric layout of text as opposed to speed or readability.

Examples
* {text-rendering: optimizeSpeed;}
.script {text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;}

Compatibility
No CSS specification (from SVG)

Firefox 3+

Notes
• This is really an SVG property that may have applications within an HTML document.
• If used in a CSS setting, it would seem more appropriately written as –moz-textrendering, but that currently is not the case.

text-shadow
This property defines a shadow effect for text.

Syntax

The shadow is defined by a comma-separated list of shadow effects to be applied to the text
of the element,
text-shadow: shadow1 [, shadow2, ... shadowN]

where each shadow value is defined as
horizontal-offset

vertical-offset [blur-radius] color

The shadow effects are applied in the order specified and may overlay each other, but they
will never overlay the text itself. Each shadow effect must specify a shadow offset horizontally
and vertically and may optionally specify a blur radius and a shadow color.
A shadow offset is specified with two length values, usually in absolute measurement,
that indicate the distance from the text. The horizontal offset value specifies the horizontal
distance to the right of the text. A negative horizontal length value places the shadow to

Chapter 6:

CSS3 Proprietary and Emerging Features Reference

709

the left of the text. The second length value specifies the vertical distance below the text.
A negative vertical length value places the shadow above the text.
An optional blur radius may be specified after the shadow offset. The blur radius is a
length value that indicates the boundaries of the blur effect.
A color value may optionally be specified before or after the length values of the
shadow effect. The color value will be used as the basis for the shadow effect. If no color is
specified, the value of an inherited color property should be used.

Examples

/* red blurry shadow right and below */
.redblurry { text-shadow: 3px 3px 5px red;}
/* sets an outline effect on the text */
.solar {background: white; color: white; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 5px;}
/* multiple shadows applied */
.ugly {text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px red, 2px -2px 0px green, -4px -4px 0px blue;}

Notes
• This property was dropped from CSS 2.1 but is included again in CSS3.
• There may be limits to the application of multiple shadows, by browser. Some initial
implementations did not allow for more than one shadow, and some capped
shadow limits at various numbers like six.
• Internet Explorer can support text shadows using its proprietary CSS filters
technology. For example,
<h1 style="filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.DropShadow(color
= "gray", offX = 2, offY = 2);">IE DropShadow!</h1>

• This property is often used in conjunction with text-fill-color.

text-stroke-color
This property defines the color for the outline of a text block.

Syntax
text-stroke-color: colorvalue | currentColor

where colorvalue is a typical CSS color value like #f00, red, and so on. The default is
currentColor.

text-stroke-width
This property defines the width for the outline of a text block.

Syntax
text-stroke-width: length | thin | medium | thick

The default length is 0, so it is necessary to set this property if using text-stroke-color,
or the outline will not display.

Note
• Under IE 8 this property is also known and should be set as –ms-text-underlineposition to correctly identify it as an extension in a standards-compliant mode.
• The value of auto-pos is also understood and is the same function as auto.
• This property has made some appearances in CSS3, but so far its future is far from
certain as an official standard.

transform
This property allows elements to be offset, rotated, scaled, and skewed in a variety of
different ways.

Syntax
transform: list of transform-functions | none

where transform-functions include the values in Table 6-11.

transform-style
This property is used to define how nested items are rendered in a 3-D space, the choice
being either flattened or with their dimensions preserved. This property affects the children
of the element and not the element itself. Also, the property does not cascade, so it is
necessary to apply it at all levels.

Syntax
transform-style: flat | preserve-3d

where the default value is flat, indicating that all children elements will be flattened into
the 2-D plane. If the value is set to preserve-3d, then the children would preserve their
dimensions.

Examples
.double {zoom: 200%;}
.double2 {zoom: 2.0;}
.reallysmall {zoom: 0.10;}
.reallysmall2 {zoom: 10%;}
#zoomOff {zoom: normal;}

Compatibility
No specification

IE 5.5+

Notes
• Under IE 8 this should be written as -ms-zoom to specify it as an extension.
• Some developers find setting the zoom property to 1.0 a useful way to force layout
in Internet Explorer when an element is not showing itself properly.
• Firefox and other browsers implement user-initiated zooming features at the
browser level. Because of this capability, this property or a similar feature will be
likely added to these other browsers for control by CSS or JavaScript some time in
the future.

Character Entities

K

eyboard characters such as < and > have special meanings to (X)HTML because they
are part of HTML tags and must be encoded. Other characters, such as certain
foreign language accent characters and special symbols, can be difficult to specify,
depending on the keyboard being used. To address escaping of special-purpose characters
and inserting a wide range of characters and symbols, character entities should be
employed.
The format of character entities is in general

&code;

where code may be a
• A decimal form like &#203;
• A hex form like &#x00CB; or stripped of leading zeros, simply &xCB;
• A named value if available, such as &Euml;

NOTE When using a hex form, either a lowercase or uppercase x may be used as well as upper-

and lowercase values for digits A–F, so &#XCB; and &#xCB; and &#xCb; and so on are all
equivalent. Case sensitivity is not, however, guaranteed for named entities and may result in
errors or wrong characters. Good style would suggest lowercase for the hex symbol and uppercase
for the digits.
As an example,

<p>Numeric entity decimal: &#163;</p>
<p>Numeric entity hex: &#x00A3;</p>
<p>Named entity: &pound;</p>

would look like this:

Encoding Quirks and Considerations
Encoding characters is quite important if you want to validate your markup. For example,
consider when you have nontrivial query strings in (X)HTML links like so:
<p>Does this <a href="http://www.pint.com/program?p1=foo&p2=bar">link</a>
validate?</p>

The markup will not validate.

For this line to validate, you must encode the special characters in the link like so:
<p>Does this <a href="http://www.pint.com/program?p1=foo&amp;p2=bar">link</a>
validate?</p>

Do not, however, take this as advice to change ampersands in typed URLs everywhere you
encounter them, such as within e-mails or the browser’s location bar. Typically, a browser
will exchange an entity for its correct value, but this change may not take place in other
environments.
Commonly, you will also have trouble when using characters that are part of (X)HTML
itself, particularly the less than (<) and greater than (>) symbols and, of course, the
ampersand that starts entities. As an example, consider this contrived example with a
mathematical expression:
<p>A silly math statement ahead x<y>z is dangerous to validation.</p>

Appendix A:

Character Entities

729

For the greatest safety, the markup should have had the special characters encoded like so:
<p>A silly math statement ahead x&lt;y&gt;z is not dangerous to
validation.</p>

We note that this example is fairly contrived and often just an extra space will allow the
validator (and browser) to tokenize the text correctly. For example,
<p>A silly math statement ahead x < y > z is dangerous to validation?</p>

will likely validate. The loose enforcement of special character handling is both a blessing
and a curse. It leads to sloppy usage and surprising bugs.
Sloppy syntax is troubling because interpretation may vary browser to browser.
Consider the point of case sensitivity of named entities in browsers. Named entities are
supposed to be case sensitive. For example, &agrave; and &Agrave; are two different
characters.

<p>&POUND; and &pound;</p>

Apparently it treats the first as text and the second as an entity.

But does that hold for all characters? Apparently not—some entities like &copy; are
generally case insensitive, while others like &trade; may vary by browser, and others like
&yen; will always be case sensitive.

Initial drafts of HTML5 attempted to formalize what named entities should be case
insensitive; these drafts focused on the commonly used and supported entities. The current
list of what should be case-insensitive named entities is shown in Table A-1.
Best practice, however, would be not to rely on case insensitivity of named entities, it is
still inconsistent. In general, lax syntax enforcement and permissive interpretation of
entities in browsers just leads to all sorts of small quirks. Consider
<p>&QUOTE; and &quote;</p>

TABLE A-1

Entities Considered Case Insensitive in HTML5

Under Internet Explorer, the rendering engine even in a strict mode will “fix” this
problem and effectively convert this into
<p>&QUOT;E; and &quot;e;</p>

while other browsers will correctly leave this mistake alone.

While it turns out that SGML (and thus traditional HTML) does allow the final
semicolon to be left off in an entity in some cases, the preceding example clearly indicates it
does not allow for that latitude in the middle of words. Just as when dealing with markup
and CSS, it is best to get syntax right rather than rely on some variable fix-up applied by a
browser’s rendering engine.
There will be instances when you may get the syntax correct but the browser may not be
able to render the characters meaningfully. The reasons for nonsupport can vary and may
be because a particular font is missing or the operating environment or browser is unable to
render the character. Generally, browsers will present these failures as boxes or diamonds,
like so:

Appendix A:

Character Entities

731

Traditional HTML Entities
Table A-2 lists the standard entities found in even the oldest versions of HTML and their
intended renderings. This is the base set of characters supported by ASCII character sets,
and future extensions for full ISO-8859-1 follow. In traditional HTML pages, authors may
use this encoding, which may be specified in the HTTP header:
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

Or more commonly, it will appear in a <meta> tag like so:
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">

However, Web page authors are always encouraged to use the UTF-8 encoding set
either by header,
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

or by tag,

unless they have some overriding reason not to.
Recognizing the move toward Unicode, we provide those values as well in all tables.
However, given the vast range of the possible characters we only present those Unicode
entities that are explicitly named in the (X)HTML specifications circa late 2009. For more
information on Unicode, see the section entitled “Embracing Unicode” later in the
appendix.

C AUTION Entity values from 127 to 159 are not assigned. Web page authors are advised not to use

them. Interestingly, some of these renderings are common, though they may work for only certain
operating system font combinations. Table A-2 puts these values in italics to emphasize they
should be avoided.

NOTE The trademark character (™) may have concerns across browsers and operating system

combinations, particularly archaic ones. Web page authors concerned with perfect backward
compatibility might want to consider using a workaround such as <sup><small>TM
</small></sup> for this symbol.

TABLE A-2

Traditional HTML Character Entities (continued)

HTML 4.x and XHTML 1.x Character Entities
The HTML 4.0 specification introduced a wide array of new character entities, including
Latin characters, the Greek alphabet, special spacing characters, arrows, technical symbols,
and various shapes. XHTML supports the same entities. Some of these entities are not
supported by older browsers such as Netscape 4.x. Most modern browsers should support
all these characters. However, up until Internet Explorer 8 some of these extended entities
were not supported in the browser under the default font. As an example, see this capture
of the difference between Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 when rendering a few
arrow entities.

Notes

Embracing Unicode
There are more special characters besides what is defined in the (X)HTML specifications.
When looking at the HTML 4 entities, you can see a mapping between Unicode characters
(such as the diamond suit character represented by Unicode U+02666 and a named entity
like &diams;), which hints at the larger character set available.
To properly support Unicode characters, (X)HTML should be delivered with the
appropriate HTTP response header:
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

or with a <meta> tag in the head element of similar value:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

In a few cases when a markup element supports a charset attribute, you can set the
character encoding value there as well.
<a href="sushimenu.html" charset="utf-8">Sushi Menu</a>

However, the header or <meta> tag solution is favored over this according to the
specification.
Unicode characters beyond what is defined under HTML 4 and XHTML 1 could be
named. To this end, the W3C has started to define entity names for XML (www.w3.org/TR/
xml-entity-names/), but these named entities are not currently supported, as illustrated by
this small example:
<p>&phone;

&#x0260E;</p>

Appendix A:

Character Entities

749

where browsers will understand the numeric code, but not the named entity.

You could pull in an XML entity declaration in an XSL style sheet to bind the items of
interest, but that is not reasonable and would get quite large, so most Web developers will
wait until such named entities are native.

NOTE HTML5 does document many Unicode entities, for example, &blacktriangledown; but
the situation is no different for HTML5 than in previous efforts; little or no support is found at
the time of this edition’s writing.

At this time and likely for some time in the future, it is preferable to use numeric entities
to insert any Unicode character into any supporting browser. For example, here
<p>&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;</p>

It should be noted that the appearance of Unicode characters may change dramatically
across browsers and systems, depending on the font supported. For example, notice the
obvious variation in the rendering of the previous example across the four most popular
browsers.

Depending on the font in place, in some cases the Unicode characters may not be
supported at all and most browsers will present the unsupported character icon, but notice
how some may indicate within it the Unicode value that is missing, which is slightly more
informative.

APPENDIX

Fonts

T

his appendix contains a quick reference for commonly available fonts and brief
discussions of downloadable fonts and various text replacement techniques to
improve online typography.

Specifying Fonts
Under HTML 4.01 and transitional XHTML 1.0, you can use the <font> tag to set a font in
a page by setting the face attribute:
<p>This is standard text.<font face="Britannic Bold">This is text in
Britannic Bold?</font>More standard text.</p>

A Web browser that reads this HTML fragment should render the text in the font named in
the face attribute, but only for users who have the font installed on their systems. To
address the possibility of missing fonts, multiple font names can be listed using the face
attribute:
<p>This is standard text.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
This should be in one of the Sans Serif fonts listed or default to the
standard sans-serif font installed</font> This is more standard text.</p>

Here, the browser reads the comma-delimited list of fonts until it finds a font it supports. If
no match is found, the browser will default to the font currently in use.
Strict variants of (X)HTML as well as the upcoming HTML5 specification remove the
role of markup in setting fonts. Of course CSS supports the same basic approach to setting

fonts using font-family and font properties. For example, to set the font more or less as
we did in previous HTML examples, you would use a rule like the following:
<p>This is standard text.<span style="font-family: Britannic Bold;">This is
text in Britannic Bold?</span>More standard text.</p>

Of course, the same restriction of fonts available on the local system applies, so a
comma-delimited list of fonts should be specified like so:
<p>This is standard text.<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sansserif;">This should be in one of the Sans Serif fonts listed or default to
the standard sans-serif font installed</span> This is more standard text.</
p>

Clearly these examples are more illustrative than appropriate, as we should use external
style sheets and the like. Our main aim in this appendix is to show that regardless of the
approach taken to effectively use fonts in this manner, we must provide an equivalent list of
fonts, or at least roughly so, across Macintosh, Windows, and Linux systems if we aim to
provide a similar text rendering. The following sections present the fonts of these various
systems so that we can determine what fonts may be used; later we’ll review ways to
specify fonts that are downloaded to remove this search for cross-platform similarity.

PC Mac Font Similarity
Inspecting the fonts in the previous sections, it should be obvious that the operating
systems do share a number of fonts that are identical or close enough for most viewers.
If a comma-delimited list of similar fonts is used in HTML or CSS, we then can likely
render text in a desired font with some assurance it might look as intended. Many Web
editors assist in choosing such fonts.

A detailed list of the common font combinations is shown in Table B-3.
While the font list in Table B-3 is commonly used, the reality of renderings across systems
is a bit variable. Obvious font differences are clear when we see some secondary fonts
chosen. For example, the difference between Comic Sans MS and Cursive is pretty obvious.
Windows

Macintosh

In other cases, we run into a more troubling situation where the font is supported on an
operating system but only in some browsers. For example, Webdings and Symbol will vary
dramatically in their browser support, as shown here:

other solutions to bring fonts to Web pages.

Testing Font Families

Downloadable Fonts
The best solution for fonts on the Web is to come up with a cross-platform font that could be
downloaded to the browser on the fly. Both of the major browser vendors have developed
their own versions of downloadable fonts. Microsoft’s solution was called Dynamic Fonts
and Netscape’s solution was called TrueDoc, but this technology was discontinued with
version 6.0 of the Netscape browser and should be avoided. Later, similar technology based
upon TrueType and OpenType fonts was added in browsers like Safari 3.1+, Opera 10+, and
Firefox 3.5+ browsers. The next section briefly discusses the viable downloadable font
technology in use at the time of this edition’s writing.

Microsoft’s Dynamic Fonts
Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows provides a fairly robust way to embed fonts in a
Web page. To include a font, you must first build the page using the <font> tag or style
sheet properties like font-family or font that set fonts. When creating your page, don’t
worry about whether or not the end user has the font installed; it will be downloaded. Next,
use Microsoft’s Web Embedding Fonts Tool1 or a similar facility to analyze the font usage on
the page. The program should create an .eot file that contains the embedded fonts. Then,
add the font usage information to the page in the form of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) style
rules, as shown here:
@font-face {font-family:"Mufferaw EOT";
font-style:normal;
font-weight:normal;
src: url(mufferaw.eot);}

1

For the Web Embedding Font Tool (WEFT), see the Microsoft Typography site (www.microsoft.com/
typography/web/embedding/weft3/), but beware: it has not been updated for modern operating
systems, so proceed with caution.

Appendix B:

Fonts

761

Now any place you want to use the font, just specify the newly embedded one as the
first font in your font list with backup fonts afterward:
p#mufferaw { font-family: "Mufferaw", serif;}

Of course as with anything, other browsers have slightly different ways of embedding
fonts.

Standard Downloadable Fonts
Other browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Opera that support downloadable fonts do not use
Microsoft’s EOT format but instead support TrueType Files. Fortunately, other than font file
format, the syntax is about the same. Here we pull in a font:
@font-face {font-family: "Mufferaw";
src: url(MUFFERAW.ttf);}

and now we set it just as before:
p#mufferaw { font-family: "Mufferaw", serif;}

Cross-Browser Downloadable Fonts
There are number of ways you might support downloadable fonts in a browser. Some Web
designers might suggest simply embedding the two versions of the fonts and then using the
simple comma fallback concept. For example,
@font-face {font-family: "Mufferaw";
src: url(MUFFERAW.ttf);}
@font-face {font-family:"Mufferaw EOT";
font-style:normal;
font-weight:normal;
src: url(mufferaw.eot);}
p#muff { font-family: "Mufferwa EOT", "Mufferaw",

serif;}

Interestingly, Internet Explorer 8 does not like this concept. Currently, however, it is easy
enough to work around this using Explorer’s conditional comments; just use the same name
and override the downloadable font format or not, depending on whether Explorer is used.
<!DOCTYPE html>

src: url(MUFFERAW.ttf);}
p { font-family: serif; font-size: 5em;}
p#muff { font-family: "Mufferaw", serif;}
</style>

PART III

The important question remains: Can we use the two forms together?

Font Replacement with Images
Since font embedding technology is still emerging, one way to guarantee the preservation of
a desired font across systems and browsers is to use CSS to replace text with images. While
this is impractical for large amounts of text, it is well suited to important design elements
such as headers and navigation.
This simple example shows the idea in practice:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Font Image Replacement Example</title>
<style type="text/css">
h1.replace

O NLINE http://htmlref.com/AppB/imagereplacement.html
While the technique relies on using an image to replace text, it does have the advantage
of degrading gracefully when CSS is not being used by the end user, as shown here:

CSS ON

CSS OFF

Some vendors have tried to automate the production of image replacement fonts using
server-side programs, but so far such an approach is not commonplace and is generally
performed by hand and only on select text items like headings.

PART III

{background: #fff url(hello.gif) no-repeat; width: 88px;
height: 24px;}
h1.replace span {display: none;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="replace"><span>Hello</span></h1>
</body>
</html>

764

Part III:

Appendixes

sIFR and Other Text Replacement Techniques
One font replacement technique that has gained favor in recent years is sIFR (short for
“Scalable Inman Flash Replacement”). sIFR basically uses JavaScript, CSS, and Flash to pull in
Flash fonts, creating smoother, less pixilated graphics. Using sIFR for large blocks of content is
not advised, but this approach is ideal for creating customized font styles for headlines and
headers. Judicial use of CSS on the content rendered by sIFR will allow browsers without
Flash or JavaScript to display a very close equivalent to the sIFR font, assuming that font is
installed on the end user’s computer. sIFR does have its problems, besides relying on the use
of JavaScript and Flash. The author has had significant problems with it in various situations
and does not recommend it despite its popularity.
Not all font replacement schemes require Flash; some JavaScript-powered schemes exist
that use the <canvas> tag and VML to create similar results. Given the fluid nature of these
techniques, we present this information more as proof that other font replacement
techniques exist, but we encourage readers wanting custom fonts to use downloadable fonts
if at all possible. If not, use the image replacement technique previously discussed instead.

APPENDIX

Colors

T

his appendix provides basic information about the use of color on the Web. The
reference not only covers the defined colors formats, names, and values from the
(X)HTML specifications and CSS but presents less obviously standardized but
commonly used color names. A brief discussion of the browser-safe color palette is also
presented.

(X)HTML Colors
Transitional versions of HTML and XHTML support color settings for text as well as the
background color of the document, frame borders, tables, or even individual table cells.
There are 16 widely known color names defined in HTML. These names and their
associated hex RGB values are shown in Table C-1.

NOTE Color names and values are case insensitive, so red and RED are equivalent, as are #FF0000
and #ff0000.

Nonstandard Color Names and Numerical Equivalents
Table C-2 lists a set of nonstandard color names commonly supported by the major browsers.
These color names were initially introduced by Netscape, and are apparently the colors
defined by the X11 windowing system for UNIX systems over two decades ago. Regardless
of their origin, these colors are documented in both the SVG specification and the emerging
CSS3 specification; they are still widely used and may someday be considered as standard as
others.
There may be some situations such as in older Opera browsers where a browser does
not support these values. Current testing shows that shipping browsers at the time of this
edition’s writing do support these values, and you can test for yourself at http://htmlref
.com/AppC/colorchart.html. If there is some concern about compatibility, Web page authors
should use hex values instead of these names.
Some color references claim that further color variations can be introduced by adding
the numbers 1 through 4 to color names. If this were correct, cadetblue1, cadetblue2,
cadetblue3, and cadetblue4 would display as different shades of the same color,

Unfortunately, testing reveals that this color variation scheme does not work under other
major browsers.
In general, Web page authors should be careful when using nonstandard color names.
In some cases, the unknown names will be interpreted as values, and other cases, the
browser will simply set the color as black.

Colors

Description

6-Hex Color

CSS’s six-digit hexadecimal format is
the same as how colors are defined in
(X)HTML. The format specifies a color
as #rrggbb, where rr is the amount of
red, gg the amount of green, and bb
the amount of blue, all specified as a
hexadecimal value ranging from 00 to FF.

div {font-family:
Courier; font-size:
10pt; color: #00CCFF;}

3-Hex Color

This is an RGB hexadecimal format with
an #rgb value, where r corresponds to a
hex value (0–F) for red, g for green, and
b for blue. For example, #f00 would
specify pure red, while #fff would
specify white. Given its data limits, the
format is less expressive than 6-Hex
Color.

span {font-family:
Helvetica; font-size:
14pt; color: #0CF;}

HSL Color

CSS3 introduces Hue Saturation
Lightness (HSL), where color values are
specified as hsl(hue,saturation,
lightness). Hue is set as the degree
on the color wheel, where if you wrap
around 0 or 360 is red, 120 is green,
and 240 is blue, with the various other
colors found between. Saturation is
a percentage value, with 100% the
fully saturated color. Lightness is a
percentage, with 0% being dark and
100% light, with the average 50% being
the norm.

#red {
color: hsl(0,100%,
50%);}

This is a CSS3 Hue Saturation
Lightness (HSL) value with a fourth
value to set the alpha channel
value for the color to define the
opacity of the element. An HSLa
is specified via a function style
hsla(hue,saturation,
lightness,alpha), where hue,
saturation, and lightness are the
same as standard hsl() values and
the alpha channel value for defining
opacity is a number between 0 (fully
transparent) and 1 (fully opaque).

#bluetrans {color: hsla
(240,100%,50%,0.5);}

RGB

CSS colors can also be defined using
the keyword rgb, followed by three
numbers between 0 and 255, contained
in parentheses and separated by
commas, with no spaces between
them. RGB color values can also be
defined using percentages. The format
is the same, except that the numbers
are replaced by percentage values
between 0% and 100%.

#p1 {color:
rgb(204,0,51);}

Like RBG color, but this adds an alpha
channel value to specify the opacity of
the color. An RGBa is specified via a
function style rgba(r,g,b,a) value,
where colors r, g, and b are specified
as decimal values from 0 to 255 or
a percentage from 0 to 100% and
the alpha channel value for defining
opacity is a number between 0 (fully
transparent) and 1 (fully opaque). Values
outside this range will be rounded up or
down to fit the closest value.

#redtrans {color:rgba
(255,0,0,0.4);}

NOTE Testing reveals that depending on operating system color changes, some browsers may not
map these UI color names correctly and often default to black.

CSS Color-Related Properties
Numerous CSS properties allow for color values. Table C-6 lists each property, a brief
example of its use, and an indication in which CSS version the property first appeared.
Readers looking for more information about the usage of these properties should see
Chapters 5 and 6, which provide a reference for standard and emerging or nonstandard
CSS properties, respectively.

NOTE Some details about browser and version support, particularly in regard to the CSS 3+ related
properties, are omitted from Table C-6. The purpose here is to provide a simple cross-reference.

Browser-Safe Colors
Early on in the days of 256-color reproduction across browsers and operating systems, a
special palette of only 216 colors that are “safe” was defined. This group of Web-safe colors
is often called the browser-safe palette. In theory, use of other colors beyond this safe set can
lead to color shifting, particularly under limited color conditions like VGA, which supports
8-bit colors, providing a mere 256 colors. The reality today is that the Web-safe palette is
more historical than worrisome, especially considering how few devices are limited to an
8-bit palette. However, many tools and designers continue to promote the use of this
palette, so we present it and its design for completeness.1

NOTE Because it is difficult to present the Web-safe colors visually in a black and white book, the
palette can be viewed online at www.htmlref.com/AppC/browserpalette.html.

The selection of the 216 safe colors is fairly understandable if you consider the additive
nature of RGB color. Consider a color to be made up of varying amounts of red, green, or
blue that could be set by adjusting an imaginary color dial from the extremes of no color to

The irrelevance of the Web-safe palette has been discussed since late 2000; see www.morecrayons.com for
references on this topic.

maximum color saturation. The safe colors use six possible intensity settings for each value
of red, green, or blue. The settings are 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%. A value of 0%,
0%, 0% on the imaginary color dial is equivalent to black. A value of 100%, 100%, 100%
indicates pure white, while a value of 100%, 0%, 0% is pure red, and so on. The safe colors
are those that have an RGB value set only at one of the safe intensity settings. The hex
conversions for saturation are shown in Table C-7.
Setting a safe color is simply a matter of selecting a combination of safe hex values. In
this case, #9966FF is a safe hex color; #9370DB is not. Most Web editing tools like Adobe
Dreamweaver and Microsoft Expression contain safe color pickers; as do imaging tools such
as Adobe PhotoShop. However, directly mapping an “unsafe” color to its nearest safe color
is fairly easy—just round each particular red, green, or blue value up or down to the nearest
safe value. A complete conversion of hex to decimal values is shown in Table C-8; safe
values are indicated in bold.

URLs

A

URL (uniform resource locator)1 is a uniform way to refer to objects and services on
the Internet. Even novice users should be familiar with typing a URL, such as
http://www.htmlref.com, in a browser dialog box, to get to a Web site. However,
URLs can be used for far more than just retrieving a Web page and can be used to invoke
other Internet services, such as transferring files via FTP or sending e-mail. Despite its
potentially confusing collection of slashes and colons, URL syntax is designed to provide
a clear, simple notation that people can easily understand. The concepts in this section will
help you to better understand the syntax of URLs, which is key to linking documents in and
beyond a Web site.

NOTE The W3C often calls what end users term a URL a URI. The W3C is working from

a more advanced view of Web addressing discussed later in the chapter. For this discussion we
always use URL, which is more broadly understood. Interestingly the HTML5 specification
drops URI in favor of the more widely understood term URL.

Basic Concepts
To locate any arbitrary object on the Internet, you need to find out the following information:
1. First, you need to locate and access the machine on the network on which the object
resides. Locating the site might be a matter of specifying its domain name or IP
address, whereas accessing the machine might require a username and password.
2. After you access the machine, you need to determine the name of the desired file,
where the file is located, the position in the file as specified by a fragment identifier,
and what protocol will be used to retrieve the information or access the object.
In other words, a URL describes where something is and how it will be retrieved. The
where is specified by the machine name, the directory name, the filename, and potentially more.

1

Some people call URLs “universal resource locators.” Except for a historical reference to “universal
resource locators” in documentation from many years ago, the current standard wording is “uniform
resource locator.”

783

784

Part III:

Appendixes

The how is specified by the protocol (for example, HTTP). Slashes and other characters are
used to separate the parts of the address into machine-readable pieces. The basic structure
of the URL is shown here:
protocol://site address/directory/filename#fragmentid

The next several sections look at the individual pieces of a URL in closer detail.

Server Address
A document exists on some serving computer somewhere on the global Internet or within a
private intranet. The first step in finding a document is to identify its server. This may be
performed by a site’s IP address,
http://10.0.0.1

though it is more likely that an alphanumeric domain name is employed,
http://www.htmlref.com

The name may be fully qualified with a machine name, a domain, an organization type,
and potentially, a country code. For example,
http://www.htmlref.com

would specify the name of a machine called “www” in the domain htmlref, which is in the
top-level COM domain. By contrast,
http://dev.htmlref.com

would reference a machine known as “dev” in the same domain.
Very often for primary Web sites within a domain the machine name is omitted, so we
simply write
http://htmlref.com

However, such configuration is up to the owner of the domain. This short-hand form
should be employed as most sites are reachable without a www prefix.
Historically, top-level domains such as those found in Table D-1 are used.

However, starting around 2001, the top-level domain space expanded quite a bit. A
sample of the top-level domains that have been added beyond the commonly known ones
is shown in Table D-2. Potentially more domains may be found at the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA) Web site (iana.org).
At the time of this edition’s writing in 2009, there is a distinct possibility that arbitrary
domains could be introduced. For example, .google might be top-level domain for all Google
properties. Even without this happening, the top-level domain space is clearly a mess, and
with generic domains on the horizon, the situation seems unlikely to get much better soon.
Geographic domains are particularly common outside the United States; such a domain
name typically contains more information than the organization type, with a fully qualified
domain name (FQDN) including a country code as well. It generally is written as follows:
machine name.domain name.domain type.country code

Zone identifiers outside the U.S. use a two-character code to indicate the country
hosting the server. These include .ca for Canada, .mx for Mexico, .jp for Japan, and so on. A
few examples are shown here.

A complete list of country codes can be found at the IANA site (iana.org).

Part III:

Appendixes

NOTE One special top-level domain, .int, is reserved for organizations established by international
treaties between governments, such as the European Union (eu.int).

Within each country, the local naming authorities might create domain types at their
own discretion, but these domain types can’t correspond to American extensions. For
example, we see that www.sony.co.jp specifies a Web server for Sony in the co zone of Japan.
In this case, .co, rather than .com, indicates a commercial venture. In the United Kingdom,
the educational domain space has a different name, ac. Oxford University’s Web server is
www.ox.ac.uk, whereby .ac indicates academic, compared to the U.S. .edu extension for
education.
The United States also uses the .us extension, although it has only recently caught on
outside of local government and k–12 educational environments. For example, www.sdcoe
.k12.ca.us is the current address of the County Office of Education in San Diego. However,
the school district opts to use a .net domain (sandi.net), and individual high schools have
even registered .com names. As in many organizations that have a choice of a regional
domain, the shorter top-level domain is preferred, and unfortunately, the .com space seems
to be the most desirable whether it is appropriate or not.

Directory
Once you reach a server, you may access a particular directory. The Web site directory that
contains all others is known as the root directory and is specified with a single forward slash.
So a URL like
http://htmlref.com/

would select the root directory of the book site. Very often users and developers will leave
off the final trailing slash when referencing a directory. It is syntactically correct for it to be
included, and if you don’t include it, your browsers or the receiving Web server will likely
add it in.
Directories may contain other directories
http://htmlref.com/ch1/

to arbitrary depth
http://htmlref.com/really/long/fake/directory/path/

On occasion you may see operating system–specific aspects to directory selection. For
example, conventionally on UNIX systems ~username will resolve to a user’s home directory
path, so
http://htmlref.com/~tpowell

might be a possible URL on a UNIX system using such a convention. We will also note that
the case sensitivity rules of the directory portion of a URL will depend on the host Web
server. For example, UNIX-based Web servers will treat http://htmlref.com/Ch1 and
http://htmlref.com/CH1/ as two different paths, whereas the same URLs referencing a Web
server using a case-insensitive operating system like Windows would resolve to a single path.

Appendix D:

URLs

787

However, do not assume that the Web server’s operating system dictates everything; for
example, URLs do not use Windows-style backslashes.

Filename
After you specify the server and the directory path for a document, the next step toward
locating it is to specify its filename. Commonly, when a simple directory-based URL is
given like
http://htmlref.com/ch1/

a default file in that directory, often named index.html, will be returned by the Web server.
However, this file could be referenced directly like so:
http://htmlref.com/ch1/index.html

File names are arbitrary,
http://htmlref.com/ch1/reallylongfilename.html

http://htmlref.com/ch1/reallylongfilename.html

and
http://htmlref.com/ch1/REALLYLONGFILENAME.html

may reference the same object or not, depending on the operating system. Filenames may
include special characters like dashes and underscores,
http://htmlref.com/ch1/really_long_file_name.html
http://htmlref.com/ch1/another-really-long-file-name.html

However, depending on the special characters used, they may be encoded (see the upcoming
section “Encoding” for more information). As an example, the filename “really long file
name.html” with spaces should encode as
http://htmlref.com/ch1/another%20really%20long%20file%20name.html

A dot separates the filename and the extension, which is a code, generally composed of
three or four letters that identifies the type of information contained in the file. For example,
HTML source files generally have a .htm or .html extension, CSS files, a .css extension,
JavaScript files, a .js extension, JPEG images have a .jpg extension, and so on.
http://htmlref.com/ch1/site.css
http://htmlref.com/ch1/bigimage.jpg
http://htmlref.com/ch1/jquery.js

A file’s extension is critically important for Web applications because it is the primary
indication of the information type that a file contains. However, it is possible to remove file

PART III

and may be case sensitive, depending on the host operating system. Thus

788

Part III:

extensions from URLs, as it is really the underlying MIME header that tells a browser what
it is getting, so it might be quite possible to serve URLs like
http//htmlref.com/ch1/listexamples

rather than
http://htmlref.com/ch1/listexamples.php

Removing extensions will aid in portability and hide implementation details from end users.

NOTE Using a URL rewriting mechanism like Apache’s mod_rewrite is the primary weapon in
cleaning URLs.

Fragment Identifier
Besides referencing a file, it may be desirable to send a user directly to a particular point
within the file. Because you can set up named links under traditional HTML and name any
tag using the id attribute from HTML 4 onward, you can provide links directly to different
points within a file. To jump to a particular named link, the URL must include a hash
symbol (#) followed by the link name, which indicates that the value is a fragment identifier.
For example, given <p id="#middle"> found in the file fragmentids.html in the ch1
directory of the book support site, we would use the URL
http://htmlref.com/ch1/fragmentids.html#middle

Protocol
Finally, we need to specify how to retrieve information from the specified location. This is
indicated in the URL by the protocol value. A protocol is the structured discussion that
computers follow to negotiate resource-specific services. For example, the protocol that
makes the Web possible is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When you click a
hyperlink in a Web document, your browser uses the HTTP protocol to contact a Web server
and retrieve the appropriate document.

NOTE Although HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, it doesn’t specify how a file is

transported from a server to a browser, only how the discussion between the server and browser will
take place to get the file. The actual transport of files usually is the responsibility of a lower-layer
network protocol, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). On the Internet, the
combination of TCP and IP makes raw communication possible. Although a subtle point, many
Internet professionals are unaware of lower-level protocols below application protocols such as
HTTP, which are part of URLs.

Although less frequently used than HTTP, several other protocols are important to Web
page authors because they are often invoked by hyperlinks. Table D-3 lists some examples.

NOTE Sometimes the protocol javascript: is used in a URL; for example, javascript:alert(‘hi’). This

is not a network protocol per se, but this form of pseudo-URL to invoke the execution of JavaScript
is commonly found in Web pages.

TABLE D-3 Some Commonly Used URL Protocols

Other Features of URLs
In addition to the protocol, server address, directory, and filename, URLs often include a
username and password, a port number, and potentially more. Some URLs, such as mailto,
might even contain a different form of information altogether, such as an e-mail address
rather than a server or filename.

Username and Password

FTP and telnet are protocols for authenticated services. It is also possible to make HTTP an
authenticated service if you password-protect a directory or file. Authenticated services can
restrict access to authorized users, and the protocols can require a username and password
as parameters. A username and password precede a server name; for example, ftp syntax
looks like
ftp://username:password@server-address

The password could be optional or unspecified in the URL, making the form simply:
ftp://username@server-address

Regardless of the protocol, we should avoid putting login identifiers and especially passwords
in URLs. If it is not specified and the resource is protected, let the server issue a challenge so
that users provide it directly.

PART III

These are the common protocols, but a variety of new protocols and URL forms are
being debated all the time. We’ll present a discussion of emerging URL forms toward the
end of this appendix.

790

Part III:

Appendixes

Port

Although not often used, the communication port number in a URL also can be specified.
Browsers speaking a particular protocol communicate with servers through entry points,
known as ports, which generally are identified by numeric addresses. Associated with each
protocol is a default port number. For example, an HTTP request defaults to port number 80.
You could say
http://htmlref.com:80/ch1/fakeexample.html

but there is no point, as the browser will use the default port for HTTP traffic anyway.
However, a server administrator can configure a server to handle protocol requests at ports
other than the default numbers. Usually this occurs for experimental or secure applications.
In these cases, the intended port must be explicitly addressed in a URL. For example, if we
ran another server on port 8080, we would use
http://notgoingtowork.htmlref.com:8080/ch1/fakeexample.html

Port number–based access is not terribly user friendly, and it intrinsically provides no
extra security other than obscurity.

Query String

Many URLs contain query strings indicated by the question mark (?). When a URL requests
a program to be run rather than a file to be returned, a query string might be passed in the
URL to indicate the various arguments to be given to the server-side program. Consider, for
example,
http://www.htmlref.com/fakeexample/registration.php?
Name=Matt+Folely&Age=32&Sex=male

In this situation, the program registration.php is handed a query string that has a name
value set to “Matt Folely,” an Age value set to “32,” and a Sex value set to “male.” Query
strings are generally encoded as discussed in the next section. Spaces in this case are
mapped to the plus sign (+), while all other characters are in the %hex value form. The
various name-value pairs are separated by ampersands (&). The encoding and decoding of
URLs is important for Web developers to understand, and a loose attitude toward allowed
encodings can quickly lead to security problems.

Encoding

Some characters may have special meaning within the context of a URL or the operating
system of the server on which the resource is found. If any unsafe, reserved, or nonprintable
characters occur in a URL, they must be encoded in a special form defined by the MIME type
x-www-form-urlencoded. Failure to encode special characters may lead to errors,
particularly in the presence of Web server security systems such as Web application firewalls.
The form of encoding consists of a percent sign and two hexadecimal digits corresponding
to the value of the character in the ASCII character set. Only alphanumeric values and some
special characters ($ - _ . + ! * '), including parentheses, may be used in a URL; other
characters should be encoded. In general, special characters such as accents, spaces, and some
punctuation marks have to be encoded, depending on the character set in play. Table D-4
shows the reserved and potentially dangerous characters for URLs.

NOTE Many of the characters in Table D-4 don’t have to be encoded, but encoding a character never

Data URIs
One form of address that has been overlooked for years but is now viable to use is the
data: URI. A data URI allows data to be encoded directly into the address. The general
syntax of a data URI is
data: [MIME type][;charset="encoding"][;base64],data

791

PART III

Character

URLs

792

Part III:

Appendixes

Given this syntax, we can include the data of this small Web page:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>data URI Encoded Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>I was encoded in a data URI!</h1>
</body>
</html>

as
data:text/html;base64,PCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw+DQo8aHRtbD4NCjxoZWFkPg0KPG1ldGEga
HR0cC1lcXVpdj0iQ29udGVudC1UeXBlIiBjb250ZW50PSJ0ZXh0L2h0bWw7IGNoYXJzZXQ9dXRm

keT4NCjxoMT5JIHdhcyBlbmNvZGVkIGluIGEgZGF0YSBVUkkhPC9oMT4NCjwvYm9keT4NCjwvaH
RtbD4NCg==

We can then load the address into a data URI–supporting browser, and it renders the
HTML page.

Since it is a valid address, we can even use this value in a link like so:
<p>
<a href="data:text/html;base64,PCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw+DQo8aHRtbD4NCjxoZWFkPg
0KPG1ldGEgaHR0cC1lcXVpdj0iQ29udGVudC1UeXBlIiBjb250ZW50PSJ0ZXh0L2h0bWw7IGN

=">What does this load?</a>
</p>

Commonly, this address form is used to include small images and icons. Here a red icon
image is placed via a data URI:
<p> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAKIAAP8AAP////+/v/9vb/
9AQP+Pj//MzP8QECH5BAAHAP8ALAAAAAAKAAoAAAMeGLrMIm0R0kwZAIxilDlZdnReCJCL2QjE0
zIAHEUJADs=" width="10" height="10" alt="*"></p>

Appendix D:

URLs

793

Anywhere a URL can be used, so can a data URI. For example, here we define some CSS
rules for unordered list icons:
<style type="text/css" media="all">
ul li.pro {list-style-image: url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhDQARAMIAAP////
7+/gAAAAEBAf39/QAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEKAAcALAAAAAANABEAAAM8eHoAASsyIIaTijoBsdZSA1j

WBpimpl2qFgwjE2/M1zbWPKcre8oo3snnkzhOkExAIgmglsyJUgCNMi6QqPEYTQAAOw==);}
</style>

Then we might use them to indicate the pros and cons of data URIs:

Some caution should be employed with data URIs, as they are not supported in
all browsers. The most notable problems are with pre–Internet Explorer 8 browsers.
Furthermore, even when data URIs are supported, there may be a limit to their size,
depending on context.
A few demonstrations of data URIs are shown in Figure D-1.

Other Emerging URL Forms
New protocols are emerging as the Web starts to converge with television and mobile
devices. For example, a telephone number might look like tel:number, where number may
include any special dialing prefixes. For example, here we have a link that would call a
directory assistance number:
<a href="tel:+1-212-555-1212">
New York City Directory Assistance
</a>

This syntax is already supported by browsers integrated with mobile devices like Apple’s
iPhone.
A television channel URL form might look like tv://channel, whereby channel is either
an alphanumeric name (such as nbc or nbc7-39) or a numeric channel number. A variety of
esoteric schemes are out there already. If you are interested in new URL schemes, take a
look at the W3C area on addressing (www.w3.org/Addressing) for more information.

Relative URLs

Using the <base> Tag
Of course, using relative URLs also has a potential downside: They can become confusing
in a large site, particularly if centralized directories are used for things such as images.
Imagine having URLs such as ../../../images/logo.gif in files deep in a site structure. Some
users might be tempted to simply copy files around a site to avoid such problems, but then
updating and caching issues arise. One solution is to use a <base> tag. Another solution is

TABLE D-5 Relative URL Formation Examples

PART III

Up to this point, the discussion has focused on a specific form of URL, typically termed an
absolute URL. Absolute URLs completely spell out the protocol, host, directory, and
filename. Providing such detail throughout a Web site can be tedious and unnecessary,
which is where a shortened form of URL, termed a relative URL, comes into use. With
relative URLs, the various parts of the address—the site, directory, and protocol—can be
inferred from the URL of the current document, or through the <base> tag. The best way to
illustrate the idea of relative URLs is by example.
If a Web site has an address of www.democompany.com, a user can access the home
page with a URL such as http://www.democompany.com/. A link to this page from an
outside system also would contain the address http://www.democompany.com/. Once at
the site, however, there is no reason to continue spelling out the full address of the site. A
fully qualified link from the home page to a staff page in the root directory called staff.html
would be http://www.democompany.com/staff.html. The protocol, address, and directory
name can be inferred, so all that is needed is the address staff.html. This relative scheme
works because http://www.democompany.com/ is inferred as the base of all future links
that omit protocol and domain, thus allowing for the shorthand relative notation. The
relative notation can be used with filenames and directories, as shown by the examples in
Table D-5.
When relative URLs are used within a Web site, the site becomes transportable. By not
spelling out the server name in every link, you can develop a Web site on one server and
move it to another. If you use absolute URLs, however, all links have to be changed if a server
changes names or the files are moved to another site.

796

Part III:

Appendixes

to use symbolic links on the Web server to reference one copy of the file from multiple
locations. However, because HTML is the subject here, we focus on the former solution
using the base element.
The base element defines the base for all relative URLs within a document. Setting the
href attribute of this element to a fully qualified URL enables all other relative references to
use the defined base. For example, if <base> is set as <base href="http://www.htmlref
.com/">, then all the anchors in the document that aren’t fully qualified will prefix http://
www.htmlref.com/ to the destination URL. Because base is an empty element, it would have
to be written as <base href="http://www.htmlref.com/" /> to be XHTML-compliant.
A simple example is presented here:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Base URL Example</title>
<base href="http://htmlref.com/">

<li><a href="AppD/basiclink.html">Basic linking example</a></li>
<li><a href="AppD/base.html">Base example</a></li>
<li><a href=".">Book Site Home Page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://htmlref.com">Book Site Home Page Alternate</a></li>

It is most interesting to run this example from another server or locally off your disk, as you
will note that the relative URLs will resolve to the book support site per the address in the
<base> tag.
Since a <base> tag can occur only once in an HTML document—within the head
element—creating sections of a document with different base URL values is impossible.
Such a feature might someday be added to a sectioning element, but until then, HTML
authors have to deal with the fact that shorthand notation is useful only in some places. See
the entry in Chapter 3 for more information on the <base> tag.

URL Challenges
While we all know and use URLs, we don’t necessarily understand all their little quirks. We
enumerate a few of the more common challenges faced when working with URLs here.

Appendix D:

URLs

797

Unclear Case Sensitivity
Are URLs case sensitive? The answer is, it depends. Domains are not case sensitive.
Addresses can be written as www.Democompany.com or www.DEMOCOMPANY.com. A
browser should handle both properly. Case typically is changed for marketing or branding
purposes. However, directory names and filenames following the domain name might be
case sensitive, depending on the operating system that the Web server is running on. For
example, UNIX systems are case sensitive, whereas Windows machines are not. Then the
question arises of query string names and values. Serious trouble can ensue when you are
sloppy with case. Assume URLs are case sensitive to avoid headaches.

Unclear Length Limits

Persistence Concerns
Documents move around, servers change names, and documents might eventually be
deleted. This is the nature of the Web, and the reason why the 404 Not Found message is so
common. When users hit a broken link, they might be at a loss to determine what happened
to the document and how to locate its new home. Wouldn’t it be nice if, no matter what
happened, a unique identifier indicated where to get a copy of the information? Links can
be maintained and errors carefully tracked, but how many developers are really that careful
with their URLs?

Long, Dirty URLs
People often have to transcribe addresses. For example, the following is quite a lot to type,
read to someone, or avoid not breaking across lines in an e-mail:
http://www.democompany.com/about/press/pressdetail.php?id=7&view=screen

Firms are already scrambling for short domain names and paths to improve the typeability of URLs, and most folks tend to omit the protocol when discussing things. Despite
these minor clean-ups, many URLs are very long and “dirty,” filled with all sorts of special
characters, encouraging fiddling by the mischievous.

Short, Cryptic URLs
Admittedly, URLs can get too long to reasonably type or remember. Worse yet, they may
simply be too long for a 140-character Twitter message. Web developers may employ a
shortened URL. For example, http://tinyurl.com/c3l7cq takes you to the archaic server-side
image map example at http://htmlref.com/ch7/serverimagemap.html. The shorter URL

PART III

How long can a URL be? The answer is unclear. Some documentation suggests low limits,
around 255 or 1,024 characters. Other documents indicate there are no limits—the answer is
dependent upon many factors. For example, user agents will vary with some supporting
user agents and web servers, whatever a system’s maximum string length is. While others
are more restrictive or have bugs that restrict URLs to a bit over 1,000 characters. Add in
Web servers and security systems, which may have their own limits on allowed URL
lengths, and you get the simple answer—nobody knows what the limit may be. Web page
authors should assume the worst and use short URLs, 255 chars or lower if at all possible.

doesn’t tell us much about where we are going. We could be visiting an HTML example,
a 1980s pop-video of Rick Astley, or some horrid drive-by malware download. Short URLs
may save space, but they are not only cryptic but potentially dangerous. Further, we must
hope that the service that powers our shortened URL lives on and that the usage data they
glean from watching users traverse the link is not used for troubling ends.

Location, Not Meaning
The primary problem with URLs is that they define location rather than meaning. In other
words, URLs specify where something is located on the Web, not what it is or what it’s
about. This might not seem to be a big deal, but it is. For example, the text of the HTML5
specification is a useful document and certainly has an address at the W3C Web site. But
does it live in other places on the Internet? For certain, it can be found at its original parent,
WhatWG, and is likely mirrored in a variety of locations. However, if we focus solely on the
W3C server and it is unreachable, or DNS services fail to resolve the host, we are stuck if we
focus on location. Rather than trying to find a particular document, wherever it might be on
the Internet, Web users try to go to a particular location. Rather than talking about where
something is, Web users should try to talk about what that something is.

Beyond URLs
Talking about what a document is rather than where it is makes sense when you consider
how information is organized outside the Internet. In general, few people talk about which
library carries a particular book, or what shelf it is on. The relevant information is the title of
the book, its author, and perhaps some other information. But what happens if two or more
books have the same title, or two authors have the same name? This actually is quite common.
Generally, a book should have a unique identifier such as an ISBN number that, when
combined with other descriptive information, such as the author, publisher, and publication
date, uniquely describes the book. This naming scheme enables people to specify a particular
book and then hunt it down.
The Web, however, isn’t as orderly as a library. On the Web, people name their documents
whatever they like, and search robots organize their indexes however they like. Categorizing
things is difficult. The only unique item for documents is the URL, which simply says where
the document lives. But how many URLs does the HTML5 specification have? A document
might exist in many places. Even worse than a document with multiple locations, what
happens when the content at the location changes? Perhaps a particular URL address points
to information about dogs one day and cats the next. This is how the Web really is. While
search engines like Google do a great deal to sort this mess out, there is still a great deal to fix,
and thus there is a great deal of research being performed to address some of the shortcomings
of Web addressing and data meaning.

New Addressing Schemes: URNs, URCs, and URIs
Consider the idea of the information describing this book. It may have a unique identifier
for it, such as an ISBN number. It has many characteristics that describe it, such as its cost,

online. It may have a canonical location, but there are likely many others.

NOTE Occasionally, URI is used interchangeably with URL. Although this is acceptable, research

into the theories behind the names suggests that the term URI is more generic than URL and
encompasses the ideal of an information resource. Currently, a URL is the only common way to
identify an information resource on the Internet. Although technically a URL could be considered
a URI, this confuses the issue and obscures the ultimate goal of trying to talk about information
more generally than in terms of a network location.

Although many of the ideas covered here are still being discussed, some existing
systems already implement many of the features of URNs and URCs. Furthermore, many
browser vendors and large Web sites are implementing special keyword navigation
schemes that mimic many of the ideas of URNs and URCs. Unfortunately, as of the writing
of this book, none of these approaches are widely implemented or accepted. URLs are likely
to remain the most common way to describe information on the Web for the foreseeable
future.

PART III

A new set of addressing ideas addresses these generic concepts. First, a uniform resource
name (URN) can locate a resource by giving it a unique symbolic name rather than a unique
address. Second, uniform resource characteristics (URC), describes a set of attribute/value
pairs that defines some aspect of an information resource. For example, in the case of a
book, a URC might describe a publication date, number of pages, author, and so on. The
form of a URC is still under discussion; however, logically what they would provide is
already being used often in the form of simple <meta> tags. Finally, the resource may have
location(s) on the Web where it lives. Taken all together, a particular information resource
has been identified. The collection of information, which is used to identify this document
specifically, is termed a uniform resource identifier (URI).

APPENDIX

Reading a Document
Type Definition

T

his appendix presents the Document Type Definitions (DTDs) for HTML 4.01 and
XHTML 1.0. Traditional HTML “dialects” are defined using SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language), a complex language with many nuances. XHTML
dialects are developed in XML (Extensible Markup Language), which is a subset of SGML
and slightly easier to work with. This appendix presents the small amount of SGML or
XML knowledge needed to read the various DTDs found online directly.

Element Type Declarations
Two common types of declarations should be familiar to Web developers: element type
declarations and attribute list declarations. An element type declaration defines three
characteristics:
1. The element type’s name, also known as its generic identifier.
2. Whether start and end tags are required, are forbidden (end tags on empty elements),
or may be omitted.
3. The element type’s content model, or what content it can enclose.
All element type declarations begin with the keyword ELEMENT and have the
following form:
<!ELEMENT name content_model >

The declaration for the XHTML br element gives a simple example:
<!ELEMENT br EMPTY>

This case says we have a br element that contains no content at all—it is empty, as shown
by the keyword EMPTY.

801

802

Part III:

Appendixes

In the case of traditional HTML, which is defined using SGML, we see a different syntax
that defines
<!ELEMENT name minimization content_model >

In the traditional DTD, we see
<!ELEMENT BR - O EMPTY>

Here, tag minimization is declared by two parameters that indicate the start and end
tags. These parameters may take one of two values. A hyphen indicates the tag is required.
An uppercase O indicates it may be omitted. The combination of O for the end tag and the
content model EMPTY means the end tag is forbidden. Thus, under traditional HTML a <br>
tag requires a start tag but not an end tag. Because a <br> tag does not contain content, its
content model is defined by the keyword EMPTY, just as it did in the XHTML specification.

NOTE Under standard HTML, the elements in the DTD are actually uppercase. While older HTML
was almost always in uppercase, newer HTML efforts are nearly always in lowercase, given the
influence of XHTML; thus we will use the common lowercase forms when discussing tags in this
appendix, though the related syntax will show uppercase.

Most HTML and XHTML elements enclose content. If a content model is declared, it is
enclosed within parentheses and known as a model group. The HTML 4.0 declaration for a
selection list option gives an example:
<!ELEMENT OPTION - O (#PCDATA)*>

The XHTML equivalent is almost identical, save the casing of the element itself and the
lack of the minimization information.
<!ELEMENT option (#PCDATA)>

Note in both cases the content model group contains the keyword #PCDATA. This stands for
parsed character data—character content that contains no element markup but that may
contain entity symbols for special characters. Keywords such as #PCDATA and CDATA are
discussed in the section “SGML and XML Keywords.”

Occurrence Indicators
In a previous example, note the asterisk appended to the model group. This is an occurrence
indicator—a special symbol that qualifies the element type or model group to which it is
appended, indicating how many times it may occur. There are three occurrence indicators:
• ? Means optional and at most one occurrence (zero or one occurrence)
• * Means optional and any number of occurrences (zero or more occurrences)
• +

Means at least one occurrence required (one or more occurrences)

Appendix E:

R e a d i n g a D o c u m e n t Ty p e D e f i n i t i o n

803

Content models can also define an element type as containing element content,
illustrated by the SGML declaration for a definition list (<dl>) under HTML 4.01:
<!ELEMENT DL - - (DT | DD)+>

The XML declaration for dl under XHTML is again only slightly different, as it omits the
minimization information and cases the elements differently:
<!ELEMENT dl (dt | dd)+>

Logical Connectors
A model group contains the names of the elements that a tag may enclose; for example, dt
and dd are found within <dl> tags. In this example we note the vertical bar separating dt
and dd. This is a logical connector—a special symbol indicating how the content units it
connects relate to each other. There are three logical connectors and one grouping
connector:
• |

Means “or” (one and only one of the connected content units must occur)
Means “and” (all of the connected content units must occur)

• ,

Means “sequence” (the connected content units must occur in the specified
order)

• ()

Used to group content units together.

Thus, the content model for a definition list says that the <dl> tag must contain either a
<dt> or a <dl> tag and can contain any additional number of <dt> or <dd> tags.

Model groups can be nested inside other model groups. Very flexible content models
can be declared by combining this with the capability to qualify content units with
occurrence indicators and logical operators. The XHTML declaration for the <table> tag
illustrates this point:

<!ELEMENT table (caption?, (col*|colgroup*), thead?, tfoot?, (tbody+|tr+))>

The content model for the table element type reads as follows:
• Table content begins with zero or one <caption> tags.
• This must be followed by a content group.
• The content group must contain zero or more <col> tags or zero or more
<colgroup> tags.
• This must be followed by zero or one <thead> tags.
• This must be followed by zero or one <tfoot> tags.
• This must be followed by one or more <tbody> or <tr> tags.

SGML Content Exclusion and Inclusion
Occasionally, the need arises to declare that an element type cannot contain certain other
element types. This is known as a content exclusion. The excluded tags follow the model
group, enclosed by parentheses and preceded by the minus sign under an SGML doctype:
(model group) - (excluded tags)

A related special need is the capability to declare that an element type can occur anywhere
inside a content model. This is known as a content inclusion. The included tags follow the
model group and are enclosed by parentheses and preceded by the plus sign:
(model group) +(included tags)

As an example, the HTML 4.01 declaration for the body element illustrates both
excluded and included elements:
<!ELEMENT BODY O O (%block;) -(BODY) +(INS|DEL)>

Why are insertions and deletions used in this declaration? The content inclusion says
that <ins> and <del> tags can occur anywhere in the content enclosed by <body> and
</body> tags. While the content exclusion says that a body element cannot contain another
body element, in this case it’s necessary because of the curious “%block” declaration used
in the model group. The leading % character identifies this as a parameter entity, essentially
a macro symbol that refers to a longer character string declared elsewhere in the DTD.
Parameter entities, which commonly occur in DTDs, are discussed shortly (see the section
“Parameter Entities”). The “%block” entity reference is a shorthand way of referring to all
block element types that happen to include <body>. It is easier to exclude <body> from the
list of block elements than to define a special-purpose declaration. Interestingly, XML
eliminates the use of content inclusion and exclusion from the XHTML DTD, and thus it is
both more verbose and in some ways simpler to read.

Attribute Declarations
Once an element’s syntax has been defined, we have to address its attributes. All attribute
declarations begin with the keyword ATTLIST, followed by the element name, attribute
name, attribute type, and default data information, as you can see in the following:
<!ATTLIST element-name attribute-name attribute-type default-data>

The HTML 4.01 <bdo> tag type illustrates a small attribute declaration:
<!ATTLIST
BDO
%coreattrs;
lang NAME
dir (ltr|rtl)
>

#IMPLIED
#REQUIRED

Appendix E:

R e a d i n g a D o c u m e n t Ty p e D e f i n i t i o n

805

The XML syntax that defines the <bdo> tag under XHTML is similar, though you should
notice that many more attributes are now available for this tag:
<!ATTLIST bdo
%coreattrs;
%events;
lang
%LanguageCode; #IMPLIED
xml:lang
%LanguageCode; #IMPLIED
dir
(ltr|rtl)
#REQUIRED
>

We note that commonly repeated attributes and values under both HTML and XHTML tend
to be minimized with parameter entities like %coreattrs, which will expand to id, class,
style, and title attributes.

SGML and XML Keywords

• CDATA Unparsed character data
• ID A document-wide unique identifier
• IDREF A reference to a document-wide identifier
• NAME An alphabetic character string plus a hyphen and a period
• NMTOKEN An alphanumeric character string plus a hyphen and a period
• NUMBER A character string containing decimal numbers
Notice that in the previous DTD fragment example for <bdo> that the dir attribute did
not declare its type using a keyword. Instead, the type is specified using an enumerated list
containing two possible values, ltr and rtl.
In the previous example for either SGML or XML, the dir attribute’s default behavior is
specified with a keyword like one of these:
• #REQUIRED A value must be supplied for the attribute.
• #IMPLIED

The attribute is optional.

• #FIXED The attribute has a fixed value that is declared in quotes using an additional
parameter. Because the attribute/value pair is assumed to be constant, it does not
need to be used in the document instance.
A default value may also be specified using a quoted string; for example, the enctype
attribute on a form element has the MIME type shown in the string that follows by default:
enctype

%ContentType;

"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

PART III

The previous SGML example declares the lang attribute as having values of type NAME,
an alphabetic string. NAME is one of several SGML/XML keywords occurring in HTML
and XHTML’s declarations of an attribute’s type:

806

Part III:

Appendixes

Parameter Entities
An entity is essentially a macro that allows a short name to be associated with replacement
text. Parameter entities define replacement text used in DTD declarations. Syntactically, a
parameter entity is distinguished by using the percent (%) symbol. Its general form is
shown here:
<!ENTITY % name "replacement text">

It is used in DTDs as follows:
%name;

Parameter entities are a convenient way to define commonly occurring pieces of a DTD
so that changes only need to be made in one place. We see in XHTML a parameter entity to
define the core attributes common to most elements.
<!ENTITY % coreattrs
"id
ID
class
CDATA
style
%StyleSheet;
title
%Text;
>

#IMPLIED
#IMPLIED
#IMPLIED
#IMPLIED"

Notice that entity %coreattrs further references entities (%StyleSheet; and %Text;)
to define values for the style and title attributes. Once defined, the core attributes could be
added to an attribute list declaration for an element as follows:
<!ATTLIST some-element

%coreattrs;>

Oftentimes, you will see entities that in turn contain further entities. For example, under
HTML 4.0, the coreattrs parameter entity is used with the i18n and events parameter
entities to define the expansion text for an aggregate entity called attrs.
<!ENTITY % attrs "%coreattrs %i18n %events">

Comments
DTDs in both SGML and XML contain comments familiar to Web page authors:
<!-- this is a comment -->

Generally these comments are used to segment the specification
<!--================ Forms =============================================-->

but in some cases, they may be used to provide explanations of particular elements or their use.
<!-- INS/DEL are handled by inclusion on BODY -->

Appendix E:

R e a d i n g a D o c u m e n t Ty p e D e f i n i t i o n

807

Comments can also be embedded inside SGML declarations for explanatory purposes.
Embedded comments are delimited by two dashes, and a single declaration may contain
many embedded comments:
<!ATTLIST PARAM
name
CDATA
#REQUIRED -- property name -value
CDATA
#IMPLIED -- property value -valuetype (DATA|REF|OBJECT) DATA
-- How to interpret value -type
CDATA
#IMPLIED -- Internet media type ->

NOTE XML does not use this “--” comment style, so you will not see it in the XHTML
specification.

NOTE As previously mentioned, HTML5 does not support a DTD syntax definition approach.

Although when authoring in this language, you may include a simple doctype like <!DOCTYPE
html>, as of 2009 the definition of this variation of HTML is not actually specified in SGML or
XML syntax.

NOTE XHTML 2 does have a DTD currently found at www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml2.dtd.

However, the specification is far from complete, and there is indication that the language may
eventually be defined as an XML schema rather than a DTD. Furthermore, circa late 2009 there
is a strong indication that the XHTML 2 specification is unlikely to ever be completed.

PART III

Now that you understand the fundamentals of reading a DTD, you should consult one to
see the precise syntax of (X)HTML directly for yourself. The latest versions of these DTDs
