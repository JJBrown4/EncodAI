What’s in It for Me?

f you value good teaching and achieving
optimum learning results for your students,
then this Teaching For Success QuickCourse is for you. It will
help you develop and refine a critical teaching skill—creating
effective learning objectives and formulating lesson plans that
will achieve the outcomes you desire. Building successful lesson
plans is where the rubber meets the road in education. This is the
key to developing effective teaching and learning sessions. This
QuickCourse is especially for those who believe, as we do, that
“just talking isn’t teaching.”
If you are new to teaching, you’ll first want to know: “What
are learning plans, and why should I know how to generate
them?” If you are an experienced instructor and can list and
define Bloom’s six levels of thinking and know how to write a

good lesson plan helps you carry out the
all-important task of setting goals and
describing how you will reach them. A lesson plan is the road map
or framework used to plan and conduct every class from first
meeting to final exam. In addition, lesson plans ensure you have
created a logical, systematic learning process essential to making
sure your students achieve the most learning in the least time.
Sure, you can walk into class without any forethought or lesson
plans and talk your way through a class session or two, but fairly
soon the lack of organization will become apparent to your students.
Winging it will soon reduce your students’ interest and motivation
to study and participate in your class. After all, they reason that if
you aren’t going to put much effort into creating a first-class learning
experience, why should they put much effort into learning?

course presentation is at best suspect
and at worst a learning gamble.
Cathedral metaphor
One way to look at lesson planning is to consider how a stone
mason would build a cathedral. After reviewing the architectural
plans, the mason expertly begins shaping each block and then
positions these blocks in an appropriate sequence to complete
the architect’s vision.
Similarly, do what the expert lesson planners do: first review
all available course documents. Particularly, look for documents
that have recorded the following for the course:
q Objectives.
q Description.
q Syllabus.
You will use the information in these documents along with
a working knowledge of learning objectives, lesson components,
and instructional design gleaned from this course to create a
series of optimized learning experiences for each class session.
If you do this, the learning activities you create will work
together to function like the rows of blocks that form the most
elaborate stone structures. Just as a mason needs many kinds
of blocks to realize a construction design, you will often need a

It’s your time
When you make an effort to become comfortable creating lesson
plans, you save yourself a great deal of time and reduce the stress of
dealing with confused and sometimes angry students whose poor
performance is a direct result of poorly designed lessons.
You owe it to yourself and to your students to learn the
fundamentals of lesson planning and put them to use each time
you prepare for a class meeting or construct an entire course.
Richard Pregent (1994) observes that “professors who have
carefully prepared lesson plans save an enormous amount of
time when you teach a course again; you have a written record
of everything you have done” (p. 97). Without plans, effective

performance.

variety of lessons to fulfill a single course objective. Taken together,
your series of lessons should complete each course objective to
produce the finished, cohesive course, like the individual blocks
that make up a beautifully crafted cathedral wall.
Taking the analogy one step further, a student’s academic career
success is built on a sound educational foundation, comprised
of interwoven courses, and it all begins with the quality of each
lesson block. Thus, each of your lesson plans constitutes a crucial
part of your students’ success.
That’s what lesson plans are all about—student success and
achievement—and that’s why you should care greatly about
learning the tips, strategies, and techniques presented in this
course.

also can provide you with a faculty or instructor handbook.
In addition, ask if a course specification sheet is available that
includes information on course objectives and expected student
performance outcomes and/or competencies.
Also, read the official course catalog or bulletin to understand
the official description of your course. This is important, because this
statement is the one your students use to make course selections.
In summary, at the very least, you need the course topics
outline and list of instructional objectives (also called outcomes
or competencies) and information on textbooks that may have
already been chosen for you or from a text that you have chosen.
Although not always possible, try to schedule a meeting with
your coordinator, department chair, or dean to review additional
course requirements and to learn about institutional expectations
for faculty performance.
After a thorough review of all the supporting documents, you
are ready to develop your lesson plans. But what are you really
trying to create, and how can you do it easily? These questions will
be examined in detail in upcoming chapters.
“Action without thinking is the cause of every failure,” says
Peter Drucker. Planning your classes without giving them much
thought is not for you. The next chapter will introduce learning
objectives.

Before you begin
Before you begin the process of creating lesson plans, obtain
the course outline and syllabus. Without these two planning
resources your only recourse is to shoot from the instructional
hip—substantially reducing the likelihood of creating successful
lesson plans.
How can you obtain a course outline and syllabus? If you are
new to teaching, you need to know that a traditional college or
university is usually divided into departments coordinated by
department chairs, or if the departments are small, a division dean
may administer a group of related departments. If your college
has neither department chairs nor division deans, then academic
matters such as course forms will be the responsibility of a provost,
vice president or dean of instruction or academic affairs.
Contact the appropriate administrative office at your college or
university and ask for a course outline, syllabus, and course catalog
description for the course(s) you will teach. Some institutions

earning objectives are
statements, usually of a
behavioral nature, that specify
what a student will be able to
do after the lesson is completed. The theory is that learning
produces measurable or demonstrable changes in learners’ thinking skills, physical capabilities or attitudes.

T

here is one foundational concept you
must understand in order to create
successful lesson plans: learning objectives and their variant,
learning outcomes. These two terms refer to concepts used at all
levels of education. If you want to discuss instruction and lesson
planning intelligently with your colleagues and administrators,
it’s necessary to develop a working knowledge of these common
terms.
Learning objectives are statements, usually of a behavioral
nature, that specify what a student will be able to do after
the lesson is completed. The theory is that learning produces
measurable or demonstrable changes in learners’ thinking skills,
physical capabilities, or attitudes. Therefore, lessons can be
constructed to reach one or more specific learning objectives.
The formal learning objective was created by those who
believed it was not good enough to create a lesson plan in which
the major stated goal was to “cover the material.” They felt
learning could be enhanced by greater specificity—basing lesson
plans on clearer, more focused learning objectives.
Unfortunately, the learning objective concept was at times
taken to extremes, and if one learning objective was good, then
ten even more specific objectives subdividing a major objective
were even better. Teachers in the 1960s and 70s sometimes felt
they were spending all their time writing lists of learning objectives
and not paying enough attention to actual instruction.
According to the work of Ralph Tyler and Benjamin Bloom
in the 1950s, mental or cognitive learning can be understood as

a hierarchy beginning at the concrete level and moving to the
more abstract. Arranging their cognitive skill structure from the
simplest to the most complex, it looks like this:
q Knowledge.
q Comprehension.
q Application.
q Analysis.
q Synthesis.
q Evaluation.
Including cognitive learning, three domains or taxonomies
of learning have been developed for each of the major types of
learning:
q Cognitive learning relates to knowledge and mental
skills.
q Affective learning involves feelings and emotions;
this type of learning relates to the attitudes, beliefs,
interests, or values the student will acquire as a result
of the lesson, such as developing appreciation for
a particular musical style or placing ethics above
profit.
q Psychomotor learning involves the acquisition of
physical skills, either kinesthetic or tactile. Successfully

cognitive domain of learning.
We’ll start with the most basic
and easiest level and then work
toward the most complex.

executing basketball free throws and performing a
specific brush stroke are examples of psychomotor
skills.
To keep this course at a reasonable length, we’ll limit this
discussion to a brief explanation of the categories that describe
the cognitive domain of learning. You may wish to expand your
knowledge to the other two domains by doing an Internet
search. One site with information on all three domains can be
found at: <http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/educ_school2/docs/
stai_manual/manual10.htm>.
Next, you’ll learn how to use these categories to create learning
objectives. The fuel gauge in a car is offered as an example to
crystallize the meaning of each of the levels that comprise the
cognitive domain. We’ll start with the most basic and easiest level
and then work toward the most complex.

amount of fuel left in the tank from the gauge reading and know
whether or not the reading requires the operator to take action,
he or she is comprehending the meaning of the gauge reading.

Therefore, at the comprehension level, students:
q Estimate.
q Predict.
q Explain.
q Summarize.

Knowledge
Knowledge refers to the remembering of basic facts, terms,
labels, methods, principles and, concepts. For example, knowing
that a fuel gauge displays the volume of fuel in a tank is
rudimentary knowledge.
At the knowledge level, thinkers:
q Define.
q Name.
q Match.
q Select.

Application
Application describes using the knowledge and comprehension
skills in new or practical situations. At this level the student can
take the fuel gauge data along with an odometer reading and
calculate miles per gallon.
At the application level, learners:
q Compute.
q Demonstrate.
q Use.
q Prepare.

Comprehension
Comprehension is about understanding what knowledge
means. For example, learning what information a fuel gauge
displays is a form of knowledge, but when a student estimates the

Analysis
Analysis is about dividing the whole into parts and identifying
the components and relationships between the parts that make
up a system or larger item.

t the synthesis level, the
student has learned sufficient knowledge, and gained
adequate comprehension, application and analysis skills to
learn how to put together a
fuel measuring system from
components.

At this level, the student learns that there are electronic,
fluid, and mechanical fuel gauges. He or she learns the parts
that make up the fuel gauge system from the measuring and
sending unit in the tank to the display unit on the dashboard
or instrument panel.
At the analysis level, students:

q Outline.
q Subdivide.
q Discriminate.

At the evaluation level, the student:
q Compares.
q Criticizes.
q Justifies.
q Supports.
In many classes, there tends to be an overabundance of
teaching to the knowledge and comprehension levels and a
dearth of effort applied toward application, analysis, synthesis,
and evaluation. Yet these top four levels comprise the bulk of
thinking needed to solve problems and to implement solutions.
Furthermore, students who are adept at problem solving and
building innovative solutions will find their careers advancing
faster and to higher levels than students who know a lot but
cannot readily apply their knowledge. To learn to apply what
this chapter teaches about learning objectives, you must learn to
think like Bloom, and that’s coming up next.

Synthesis
Synthesis is the inverse of analysis: combining the parts into
a new whole.
At this level the student has learned sufficient knowledge
and gained adequate comprehension, application, and analysis
skills to learn how to put together a fuel measuring system from
components. The student is thinking at the system level, and
could well design and build a different type of structure from
what currently exists.
At the synthesis level, the student:
q Categorizes.
q Rearranges.
q Combines.
q Composes.
Evaluation
Evaluation is the pinnacle of cognitive learning and is
concerned with the ability to determine the value or worth of
something. The student at this level could critique a fuel gauge
design and recommend improvements, or determine that is not a

earning objectives help you
walk through any complex
subject in a clear and balanced
fashion. They should be phrased
in any way that makes sense to
you and is easily communicated
to your students your supervisor.

T

he easiest way to become further
acquainted with Bloom’s taxonomy of
cognitive skills is to work a practical example through all the
levels, from comprehension to evaluation. In this chapter, we’ll
create a set of learning objectives for teaching a module on fuel
gauge systems to automotive technicians at each of the six levels
of cognitive learning. Now, admittedly, the human brain does
not precisely support such a breakdown of thinking skills into
these compartments, but the system will help you plan lessons
that contain more complex learning.
Knowledge—given an instrument panel comprising several
gauges and indicators, the student correctly locates and labels
the fuel gauge.
Comprehension—given a fuel gauge reading three-quarters
full, the student predicts whether the vehicle’s engine will start
and run.
Application—given the miles a vehicle is driven and the fuel
gauge reading at the start and end of the trip, the student will
calculate the fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon.
Analysis—given the vehicle’s repair manual, the student can
identify the wiring and parts of the fuel gauge system.
Synthesis—given the voltage readings at various points of the
fuel gauge system, the student identifies the defective part.
Evaluation—given the design specification for a new vehicle,
the student describes the most cost-effective fuel gauge system
design and the design trade-offs among accuracy, reliability,
maintainability, and installation cost.

Learning Outcomes
Lesson plans, then, are created from an organized set of
specific learning objectives. If you find that Bloom’s taxonomy
doesn’t fit how you think about your subject, you may prefer to
create a set of learning outcomes.
What is a learning outcome? A more modern term, “learning
outcome” refers to a statement in your own words of how
your students will demonstrate that they have mastered the
material.
A learning outcome for a class on automotive fuel gauges
might read like this: After completing the chapter on fuel
systems, the successful student will work with a project group
whose task it will be to prepare a five-minute class presentation
on the various types of fuel gauges, how they function, and the
strengths and weaknesses of each design.
A learning outcome can be phrased in any way that makes
sense to you and communicates the learning intentions to you,
your students and your administrator.
Now it’s your turn: On page 10 you will find the first planning
form, designed to help you sit down with your textbook and
syllabus and create a set of learning objectives based on Bloom’s
taxonomy of thinking skill levels.
The goal here is to ensure that you create learning objectives
at the higher levels of thinking skills. Without this planning

sheet, and referring to Bloom’s levels, you will have a tendency to
create learning goals at the lowest levels, such as knowledge and
comprehension, thus depriving your students of development at
the higher thinking levels of learning.
The chart you’ll find on the next page illustrates how to use
Bloom’s taxonomy of thinking skills to create learning objectives
for a typical concept-centered class—and what better class to
use as an example than a class covering Teaching For Success
concepts?
First, browse through the examples (in red type) at each
level and note how simple and concise learning objectives can
be. Space is provided at the top of the form to write a general
learning or, if you like, performance objective for a single class
session or unit of instruction.
Then, subordinate objectives can be created at as many
specific thinking skill levels as is appropriate to the content,
as demonstrated in this example. A blank copy of this form is
provided for you to print according to your needs in the Lesson
Plan Template section at the end of this course.
If this form is not to your liking, take a few minutes and create
a form that better supports the way you think and work. The
important point here is to stress the advantages of working
with learning objectives and guard against any tendency to go
overboard with too much complexity.
The bottom line, use Bloom’s taxonomy to create learning
objectives that ensure students learn and practice at the highest
levels of thinking skills in each topic.

An Engaging Format

A

t the very least, the format
you choose should have a
logical sequence of components
that provide your students with
the activities and resources they
need for optimum learning results.

A

learning outcome of this QuickCourse
should be for you to finish with an easyto-use lesson planning format with an optimal learning structure
and an understanding of how to fill out each section. In order
to realize this goal, you will benefit from considering a unique
lesson format recommended by Teaching For Success.
The lesson format you ultimately select should be the one
that helps you easily prepare and organize each lesson, and the
one that is most effective in helping your students achieve their
learning goals.
At the very least, the format you choose should have a logical
sequence of components that provide your students with the
activities and resources they need for optimum learning results.
An important question to consider when selecting a lesson
plan format is this: are you the one responsible for specifying the
content and sequence of learning in your course? If you’re not
responsible, you may be required to use lesson plans that have
been created by another instructor. Or, you may be expected to
rely totally on a textbook to specify all learning activities.
If either of these latter cases applies to you, don’t quit now,
because this QuickCourse can provide you with valuable insights
into the future design and organization of effective lessons.
But whatever your teaching situation, the bottom line with
lesson planning is this: plan on paper! Then you can make
changes and improvements and communicate what’s happening
in your course to all involved. Donald Greive (1998) makes this

observation: “The format for the lesson plan may vary. Probably the
only thing universally agreed upon is that the lesson plan should
be written down. It should have a definite purpose indicating the
main thoughts for the lesson, and it should be numbered and
arranged as part of the total plan for the course” (p. 23).
Because so much has been discovered about the teaching and
learning process during the past decade, it’s well worth your time
to take an in-depth look at the six-part teaching and learning
system adapted from the recommendations offered by Colin Rose
as a handbook, Accelerated Learning Action Guide, published by
Nightingale-Conant (Niles, IL).
This action guide accompanies the “Accelerated Learning
Techniques” audio learning program also sold by NightingaleConant. For more information on obtaining this excellent
program, call Nightingale-Conant at 880-323-5552.
TFS recommends this resource purely on the quality of the
ideas presented and not because we have any business relationship
with this company.
At TFS, we have adapted this model of personal learning to the
classroom setting and have called it the PIE-R3 model, pronounced
“pie-R-cubed” for easy memorization. The next chapter will
explain this lesson format and its components in detail.

wo good inside-the-box questions are: can these steps be
accomplished in any order and
can a step be deleted or skipped?
Ideally you should go through
each step in the lesson sequence
in order, but there are always exceptions. You are the ultimate
decision maker. .

S

ometimes thinking within the box is helpful when
you are learning the basics of a new concept.
That said, it’s time to explain each of the steps in this accelerated
lesson format in detail. Again, these lesson steps are discussed in the
sequence that they would be presented to students.
Two good questions are: Can these steps be accomplished in any
order? And, can a step be deleted or skipped? Ideally you should go
through each step in the lesson sequence in order. However, there
are always special teaching circumstances that call for innovation
and change. But unless there is a good reason for deviation, you
should strive to present each of the following steps:
 Prepare—Begin lesson planning with the end in
mind, and devote time to learning warm-ups—this
will save you and your students time.
 Input—Present the content in visual, auditory, and
hands-on learning experiences; teaching genius means
knowing how to reduce the complex to a simple yet
accurate expression of the same knowledge—for
example, E=mc2. Be sure students formulate questions
they are interested in answering.
 Explore—Your students learn the most in the least
time when they are encouraged to explore the material
using their preferred learning styles, intelligence sets,
and modes of expression.
 Recall—Learning retention is significantly increased
when students personalize and emotionalize the
material.

 Retain—Teach self-testing—the best students know
the value of reviewing early and often and self-testing
their knowledge and skill acquisitions.
 Reflect—Both instructor and learner must constantly
gather performance observations, and then reflect
on improvement action steps.
An easy way to remember the steps in this lesson model is to
remember the formula for the area of a circle, A=∏r2. Changing
that common formula slightly to the mnemonic PIE-R3 will help
you remember the sequence of instructional events. This system is
built on the learners’ needs. It endeavors to provide in sequence the
learning activities that make the most instructional sense:
 Prepare.
 Input.
 Explore.
 Retain.
 Reconfirm.
 Reflect.
Lets look now at the details of each of the PIE-R3 lesson-plan
steps. A good rule of thumb in lesson planning is to use Albert
Einstein’s planning principal, “Everything should be made as
simple as possible, but not simpler.”

Prepare: PIE-RRR
Preparing to learn is the natural, common-sense starting point
of learning, and therefore should be the first teaching activity. But
it’s a step too often ignored in the hurry to cover as much material
as possible in each class meeting. The PIE-R3 learning model begins
with the preparation phase because it’s crucial for good teaching
and optimized learning.
Accelerated learning experts contend that taking time to
prepare to learn increases the rate of learning by two to three
times. Skipping this vital step only slows and hampers learning in
the long run and is very expensive in terms of increased time to
learn and lowering “Learning Return On Energy” (LROE).
This is the point in your class planning to think about how you
can encourage your students to arrive on time. If the first order of
business in your class is to take attendance, return assignments,
hand out new study sheets, announce the date of the next unit
test, and remind students there will be no class meeting next
Monday because of a holiday, you have failed to provide any
activities designed to prepare students to learn the lesson.

Repeating confidence-building assertions before starting a study session, such as, “I’m a terrific learner.” It
works wonders in keeping energy high.
 Adopting strict time-management practices—such
as working on the most difficult learning task first.
 Maintaining peak levels of self-motivation by suggesting students set some post-class rewards such as
enjoying a coffee break, instant messaging a friend or
shopping for the latest music releases on-line.

Preparation activities

Some possible activities that creatively prepare students for
new learning include:
 Creating a positive, expectant attitude of successful
learning and learning outcomes.
 Forming and maintaining a creative, relaxed, resourceful mindset with brief meditation, imaging, or breathing exercise breaks.
 Writing learning goals and reviewing these before
each study session.

Input: PIE-RRR
After you’ve helped your students prepare to learn, move up
to the second rung in the lesson ladder, input.
Accelerated learning gurus such as Colin Rose suggest that
multisensory input is a crucial component of good instruction.
A fundamental precept of accelerated learning is this: The
more senses that are involved in the learning, the more rapid
and memorable the learning will be, and the more quickly the
specified learning outcome can be achieved.

T

o achieve multisensory input,
a good lesson design should
be more than a traditional lecture,
and it should encompass some
active learning concepts to engage
the minds of the students more effectively than a lengthy lecture.

Let’s consider a student who completes several of the
recommended Preparation steps. This student is now more
relaxed, focused, motivated, and ready to learn.
But, now what? Sure, it might be easiest from your point of view
to plan a traditional lecture for the entire class period, but how many
senses will be engaged? How will the students participate?
Activating the input stage

To achieve multisensory input, a good lesson design should
be more than a traditional lecture, and it should encompass
some or all of the following concepts:
 Connect the subject to the learner in terms of
students’ prior experience, current academic skills,
and learning goals.
 Pose tough questions and point up debates, dilemmas,
and dichotomies inherent in your subject area.
 Provide applications, applications, applications—
overcome the “I’ll-never-use-that” syndrome; make
learning concrete, practical, useful.
 Picture the problem or concept; challenge students to
portray the idea visually—use metaphors; ask, “If this
concept were a famous painting, which one would it
be and why?”
 Convert the concept or problem you are studying to
one of the other senses: ask students, “What would
this feel, taste, or sound like?”
 Take a kinesthetic learning break—ask a multiplechoice survey question—one about which you know
students will have a range of opinions; then ask students
to quickly get up from their seats and stand in a line by
the choice they prefer; a human chart results.



Websites and commercial media outlets provide a
wealth of audio and video material, and today you
can burn your own audio CD-ROM and even produce
excellent amateur video presentations—Apple’s iDVD
program makes producing videos an enjoyable task.

How to organize knowledge

Students need structure, variety, challenge, application, and
activity. There are five common ways to structure knowledge for
presentation during the input stage of the lesson. It would be a good
idea to memorize these so you have them instantly recallable:
 Complexity—simple to intricate.
 Age—forward or reverse chronological order.
 Distance—near to far.
 Solidity—concrete to abstract.
 View—big picture to details.
Use one or more of these structures to make multisensory
input follow a meaningful pattern. Too many instructors fail to
choose a logical approach. This lack results in their students complaining about the difficulty of learning the material. To help all
your students learn more quickly and retain more course content, shape your teaching so that students have the opportunity
to see, hear, and use the core facts, principles, and concepts central to your course.

Exploration: PIE-RRR
Exploration is the term used to describe the customtailoring and personalization necessary for effective learning.
When exploration is planned into a lesson, learning becomes
accelerated, fun, authentic, and effective.
Learning outcomes are more readily reached when you help
your students personally explore the landscape of new material
through their various intelligence sets, rather than in lock-step,
mono-mode, learning activities.
Explorers of all types usually have a say in how they plan to reach
their destination, and so should your learners in the exploration
stage. Your students need coaching and an opportunity to have
their learning problems diagnosed, rather than having a content
expert tell them everything they need to know. They thrive on
learning choices; not everyone needs to take the same exploratory
learning path.
Your students will feel put off and alienated if you only
present material in one intelligence mode, such as linguistic, or
one sensory mode, such as audio. Traditional teaching assumes
everyone learns the same way and pure lecture is good enough
for everyone.

I

n addition to teaching content, you should design a
range of challenging lessons and
assignments to help learners
explore the material in a manner consistent with their special
weave of intelligences.

exercises needed to build specific physical skill. A skilled physical
trainer or coach can analyze one’s current physical skill level and
create a program to move her or him to a new level of adroitness
and competence.
The same process works in cognitive learning. The teacher as
coach assesses the current level of each student’s academic skill
and then creates an activity program to optimize learning.
Therefore, in addition to teaching content you should design
a range of challenging lessons and assignments to help learners
explore the material in a manner consistent with their special
weave of intelligences.
You can use Dr. Gardner’s intelligence categories as a guide to
planning a wider variety of lesson content that will reach more
students:
Multiple intelligences?
 Linguistic.

Besides recognizing multiple intelligences, you can improve
the Exploration phase of learning by asking your students to:
 Identify assumptions.
 Discern the evidence of credibility.
 Create metaphorical visuals and examples.

 Select and solve key problems.

r

etention tip

Though eschewed by many educators, there is still a great
need for learning how to rapidly and accurately memorize
definitions, facts, formulas, and procedures. For some tips
in this area we recommend The Memory Bible by Gary Small,
M.D.
Dr. Small recommends using the look, snap, and connect
memorization system. Briefly, “Look” means to carefully
observe the thing to be remembered. Note the details: color,
shape texture, smell, weight, etc.
Next, “Snap” is a series of mental pictures of the object or
data to be remembered. Snapping a colorful, detailed, and
vivid mental image will improve the likelihood of recalling it
later. Keep in mind that the more wild and fanciful the snapshot image, the easier it is to remember.
Lastly, “Connect” the images with a story that correctly
sequences the snapshots and makes them easily recallable.
Optionally, you can create a single visual that contains all the
snapshots in a meaningful pattern, or create an acronym to
remember the first letter of the title of each snap. Why not
teach your students to look, snap and connect?

Retain: PIE-RRR
Modern brain research confirms what outstanding teachers
have known all along: learning retention takes place when the
material is relevant and meaningful, processed by many senses,
and emotionally stirring. A good lesson plan answers the question:
How can I ensure that students will retain the material long after
the class is over?
Effective study—that which is meaningful, concise, an
success-oriented—is the key to establishing excellent recall. To
maximize recall, students need to have the following components
incorporated into each lesson:
 Adequate practice with improvement feedback from
the instructor; for example, homework assignments
evaluated and returned with improvement
suggestions listed.
 Personalization of the content—an opportunity
to take knowledge apart, reassemble it, and then
express it in one’s own thoughts and terms.
 Time and encouragement to express doubt and
direct questions to learning peers, the instructor, and
real-world practitioners.

Homework length and complexity issues

Homework is essential to learning, and should be a part of your
lesson plan. You may feel the expectation from yourself, other
instructors, and your students to assign a hefty amount. But how
much homework is optimal? Here are some points about homework to consider when developing a lesson plan:
 Length—the time an average student is expected to
spend to complete the assignment; don’t give more
practice problems than needed.
 Difficulty—each practice assignment should include
easy, medium, difficult, and challenging problems.
 Context—are the practice activities meaningful? Are
they in terms that connect with the students’ reality
in some way?
 Feedback—how will student responses and answers
be critiqued and improvement suggestions be transmitted to them?
 Variety—does the assignment give the student a
thorough workout of all mental muscles?
Gagné, Briggs and Wagner, in their Principles of Instructional
Design, stress adding variety to homework and in-class practice sessions to help students apply knowledge to new situations or retain
and transfer learning from the classroom to the real world.

H

omework is essential to learning, and should be a part of your lesson plan. You
may feel the expectation from yourself, other instructors, and your students to
assign a hefty amount. But how much homework is optimal? Simulations and realworld case problems often provide needed practice in critical thinking.

Reconfirm: PIE-RRR
All students must periodically reconfirm what they have
learned in order to transfer the new knowledge and skills into
long-term cognitive and muscle memory, depending of the type
of learning involved. Here are some specific, active reconfirmation
strategies that you can build into your lesson plan to help your
“A” students learn faster, your “B” students become “A” students,
and your “C,” “D,” and “F” students improve.
Reconfirmation activities require discipline and effective
study skills that some students master early in their academic
career while others struggle into their college years before it all
comes together for them. The misguided study goal for many
students is to complete the assigned work as soon as possible.
However, just completing the work does not necessarily
lead to retention. The most important retention technique for
underachieving students to learn is adopting a regular review
schedule both in and out of class. Adequate review time and
activities must comprise part of your lesson plan.
Most poor students fail to review often enough. Here’s a very
effective pattern that will produce terrific results. For maximum
retention, students should review after:
❑ One hour.
❑ One day.
❑ One week.
❑ One month.
❑ End of course.
Teaching your underperforming students how to review is as
important as providing them with time to review. One of the
simplest yet most powerful strategies is to ensure students verbalize learning in their own words.

R

econfirmation activities
require discipline and effective study skills that some
students master early in their
academic career and some
struggle into their college years
before it all comes together for
them.

At home, they can even record these explanations on audio
tape or digitally as a computer sound file. Then, they can add music
(classical works best but this musical style may not be the favorite
of your students) to another track. Finally, if they play this voicemusic recording when relaxed before sleeping or upon rising, they
will tap both sides of the brain and review is accelerated.
In addition, have your students list comparisons—another
dynamic active review. They first make a list of the main points,
writing them in their own words. Then, they study them for a
short time, put the list away and attempt to recreate this list
from memory. A comparison of the two lists will quickly reveal
what they’ve missed. This list comparison process continues until
the original and final lists match perfectly.
The ultimate purpose of this Reconfirmation stage in your
lesson is for students to “show they know,” validating mastery
of skills, knowledge, and attitudes. To this end, you should also
provide in your lesson plan test reviews and practice tests to
prepare students for a graded exam.
Here are three more instructional principles that go to work in
the well-designed Reconfirmation step in an A+ Lesson Plan:
q Outstanding students achieve more because they
continually reconfirm their subject mastery.

U

nfortunately, the Reflect
step in teaching and learning is often just as neglected in
the rush to cover the material
and call it a day. Reflection is
the sixth, last and most crucial
phase of the PIE-R3 model.

q Struggling students, on the other hand, may fail
because they haven’t developed good self-test skills.
q To assist your students, help them make self-testing a
priority, unbreakable habit during learning .
At the bottom line, your lesson plan must have a stage where
proof of learning is confirmed by a written test, oral exam, evaluation
of a practical demonstration, log, journal, paper, project, or learning
summary. Give students an chance to show they know.

A second Reflection step is completed when you create an
ongoing self-reflection Success Contract. Such a contract results
from answering the following questions:
❑ The most important thing I learned about teaching
or learning is					
.
❑ I will apply what I have discovered to my next learning
activity, class meeting, unit, or course by		
.
❑ When I encounter obstacles, I will overcome them
by							
.
❑ I will track my results by­				
.
❑ If I need assistance to reach my goals, I will seek
assistance from (person) or consult this reference or
resource 							
.
❑ I will reward myself by
when I reach my goal!
As Arturo Toscanini, the noted Italian symphonic and operatic
conductor, once wrote, “Nobody knows what is the best he can
do.” When you regularly stop to reflect and generate a modified
lesson plan from the old one, you teach for success, and great
improvement is possible.
Now you have at least two lesson formats to pick from, or
you may choose a format that blends well with your own training
and experience. But do pick a format you will use routinely.

Reflect: PIE-RRR
At TFS, we modify the adage, “If you can’t measure it, you
can’t manage it,” to read, “If you don’t reflect on it, you won’t
improve it.” Reflection is the sixth, last, and most crucial phase
of the PIE-R3 model. Unfortunately, the Reflect step in teaching
and learning is often just as neglected in the rush to cover the
material and call it a day. In the face of demanding schedules
some instructors decide that this is a step that can be easily left
for the odd moment.
However, for you to improve your teaching via an A+ Lesson
Plan and for your students to improve their learning skills, it’s
imperative that you and they reflect on what has or has not been
accomplished in the last unit, chapter, class meeting, or learning
activity before proceeding to the next topic.
Be sure to add the following two-question thought exercise—
step one of an effective Reflection learning event—at the
conclusion of each lesson you plan. Using a computer or pad of
paper, prepare a two-column sheet. Head the columns with the
following questions:
❑ What went well? (Reflect)
❑ What could I have done better? (Correct)

Reality Check

he A+ Lesson Plan is one that
communicates very clearly
to you and to your students the
intended
specific
learning
objective(s) or outcome(s), and
the strategy and resources you
will employ to help learners reach
the stated goal(s).

B

efore going on, let’s look at reality. The
perfect A+ Lesson Plan is not one that
creates the perfect lesson. Teaching and learning is part art
and part science, and when the variables are factored in for a
group of students from one class to the next, you will find that a
lesson that works beautifully one term may cause confusion and
exasperation among a new group of students the very next time
the lesson is taught.
The steps of the PIE-R3 lesson format we have discussed are
available in a table format you can print and refer to during the
rest of this course, and to use for actual lesson planning at the end
of this course. Click here to see these tables now.
The A+ Lesson Plan is one that communicates very clearly to you
and to your students the intended specific learning objective(s)
or outcome(s), and the strategy and resources you will employ to
help learners reach the stated goal(s). Also, the A+ plan is one that
meshes well with the preceding and succeeding lessons to form
an organized set of lessons that will form the successful course.
An A+ Lesson Plan retains flexibility and states some back-ups
or alternatives and some instant feedback processes that can be
used to receive immediate feedback from students on the lessons’
actual effectiveness. (See Classroom Assessment Techniques by
Thomas Angelo and K. Patricia Cross.)
More about topics
A standardized departmental course outline may include lists
of objectives or a general topic list, often in chronological order.

If there is no standard course outline or topic list, review
course objectives. Develop a chronological list of general topics
to be addressed in order to achieve each objective.
For example, a speech or composition departmental topic
of “Purpose” precedes “Organizational Principles” and follows
“Topic Selection.” Without a topic, a purpose cannot be
considered. Until students formulate purposes, decisions about
organizational presentation cannot be made.
List specific topics necessary to an understanding of each
general topic. One or more specific topics comprise a lesson,
and more than one lesson may be required to explain a general
topic.
Lesson plan topics are what will be presented during a class
meeting in a single planning block of time. One-hour or 50-minute
planning blocks are convenient beginnings, since the shortest
classes generally fit this time frame.
Another way to look at a topic is knowledge-based rather
than time-based. For example, a topic could be the smallest
coherent piece of knowledge that answers a question, provides
a procedure to solve a problem, or allows two or more previous
topics to be synthesized into a larger whole.

Time is of the essence
In traditional models of instruction, time is of the essence and is
held fixed. Achievement standards are variable—a student may pass
with any grade from a D to an A. If you teach in a mastery learning
institution, time is made flexible and mastery standards are fixed.
When lesson planning to fit the classic model of instruction,
consider carefully the time actually required for presenting and
learning. In one case a topic may require an average of 30 minutes,
yet another requires only 10 minutes. A single topic, or a series of
topics, may be considered during one class meeting.
Chronologically, list the topics that are necessary for
developing an understanding of the general topic. To do this,
figure out which topic is prerequisite to another.
For example, an understanding of specific purposes must
be established before thesis statements are discussed. Thesis
statements identify what an audience must understand in order
to achieve a purpose. Thus, student understanding of specific
purpose is prerequisite to thesis statements.
Assign each lesson plan a sequence number. Use text chapters,
course objectives, or competencies. Numerically, identify the
general topics with a number and assign each lesson a sequence
number, i.e., 4:1, 4:2, and 4:3, where 4 is the general topic and
the following numbers are individual lesson blocks. Textbook
chapters or competency numbers are advisable when instructing
multiple sections of varying lengths.
Finally, write a lesson headline or title to advertise the lesson
in a course calendar. Be creative. Which title stimulates your
thinking: “Purpose” or “Determining Your Purpose”? Make your
titles fit the personal interests of your students.

W

ith great lesson plans and intelligent teaching and learning activities, you
can be part of the success story of each of your students!

Preparation and Input

Y

ou have a problem when
students ask themselves,
“Why should I listen and participate in this class session?”
Designing lucid, meaningful lessons that connect with learners
is the answer to this tough
teaching challenge.

Y

ou have a problem when students ask
themselves, “Why should I listen and participate in this class session?” Therefore, lesson introductions or
advance organizers should be constructed to answer the following question from the students’ point of view: “What is the value
of today’s lesson for me?” This is the purpose of the Preparation
component, the first step of any lesson.
So what can you do to overcome student doubt and lack of
interest? Try one or more of the following to gain attention and
better prepare your students to learn:
q Open with a startling fact, question, or issue designed
to capture the audience’s attention.
q Ask an overt-response question to gauge their
knowledge, experience, or attitudes about the coming
topic, or pose a rhetorical question that invites
thought and mental engagement.
q Emotionally, relate a short story to establish a specific
mood conducive to student involvement in a portion
of the topic to be studied, or relate a quotation (with
feeling) from a familiar source to capture the essence
of the lesson.
q Chronicle a personal experience to your students to
illustrate some aspect of the lesson for the day. This
technique also demonstrates a personal expertise and
knowledge of the topic. Thus, students know what
they learn comes from a reliable source.

Prepare by connecting
We all listen for personal benefit, especially in a class. Therefore, prove the relevance of your class by relating:
q Generally, how this lesson applies beyond passing an
examination.
q Specifically, when and how this knowledge or skill will
affect their lives in the future.
You may find it effective to connect your lesson’s objective
to one or more of Maslow’s five categories of human needs:
survival, safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.
Determine which of these needs most closely correlates with
lesson outcomes. Also, consider all the possible family, social,
educational, community, and professional contexts that can be
connected to the present, past, or future lesson outcomes.
Input styles
One aspect of the Input phase of a lesson that is sometime
overlooked is the students’ preferred learning style. Students
usually prefer to learn by one of three methods of encountering
new material:
q Verbal­—hearing.
q Visual—seeing.
q Kinesthetic—touching and manipulating.

There are tests that can be given to help determine the learning style of each student, but this is often impractical for you to
accomplish in the already jam-packed college course. The best
solution is to plan to teach using all three modes of learning.
Analyze the content of your course to determine how you can
introduce new knowledge visually, auditorily, and by a hands-on
approach. By carefully mixing all three learning modes in your
classes, you will be offering something in the preferred style of
all your students. Ensuring that you offer many kinds of learning
activities will greatly enhance and speed learning.

C

ase Study Presentations include an introduction of a
case by the instructor with questions-and-answers. This is often
followed by a in-depth discussion.

Lecture
Probably the first method that comes to mind when you
think about how to introduce new knowledge during a lesson is
to lecture. Today, lectures range from the traditional, formal lecture (instructor talks and the students take notes) to the more
modern and interactive style lecture that makes use of small
group discussions and other processes. For more details on new
lecture techniques and strategies, see the TFS QuickCourse,
“How to Activate Your Lectures.”

interests and attention to the subject under study. Demonstrations require preparation to ensure they proceed without glitches
and interruptions from equipment problems. Demonstration can
also be virtual using multimedia equipment.
Laboratory Sessions and Field Trips may follow lecture or
include lecture during the session or trip. They often include ongoing question-and-answer investigations. This method bridges
lecture and group-learning techniques. Students may work
together in pairs or small teams to gain hands-on experience in
a laboratory or shop. Field trips bring the energy of new learning
environment and the chance to see, feel, smell, and touch the
subject as it applies to real-world situations.

More involvement and action
Case Study Presentations include presentation of a case by
the instructor with questions and answers; this is often followed
by small group analysis and discussions. This approach provides
opportunities to examine theory in relation to an actual event,
while combining lecture and discussion features. Groups of students may examine a case report and discuss the group’s observations in a classroom discussion.
Demonstrations are variations of the more informal, question-and-answer-based lecture. Demonstrations draw students‘

Groups
Class Discussion, the most basic form of group discussion,
requires careful planning to be a success. Initiating classroom discussion requires careful formulation of thought-provoking, objective questions, an understanding of questioning techniques, and
the communication of the purpose and benefits of the discussion
to the students. Group learning can be accomplished by breaking your class down into active learning units. For great ideas on
managing small groups, see the TFS QuickCourse, “Making Small
Group Learning Work.”

aboratory sessions and
field trips may follow
lecture or include lecture during the session or trip. They
often include on-going question-and-answer investigations.

Implementing group learning will allow more students to
become actively involved, encourage reticent students to participate, and pool more experience and ideas. Small groups may complete their learning task, then relate their findings to the class.
Want more? Additional group possibilities, as discussed by
Neff and Weimer (1989), are:
q Brainstorming generates ideas, information, or solutions in short, specific amounts of time.
q Buzz Groups are usually 3-5 members who meet in
class for 10-15 minutes, discuss a single question, and
report their findings to the entire class. The primary
feature is the short amount of time.
q Case Study is a written document about a real problem that a student studies. A guide is supplied the
student, usually with a list of suggested reading. After
one or two weeks of analysis, students present findings and analysis for group discussion. A written
paper accompanies the presentation.
q Concentric Circles place a small circle of participants
inside a large circle. The inner circle discusses a topic
while the outer group listens. The discussion roles
then reverse.
q Debate/Discussion uses pro-and-con participants
who consider a controversial subject. The goal is to
convince the audience, not attack the opponent.
q Panel/Discussion is a small group discussing an idea
among themselves, in front of the class, who then
join in later.
q Phillips 66 uses six people who discuss their views,
opinions, or experiences on a topic for 6 minutes.

q Picture-Making Groups highlight a principle or idea
related to a topic by drawing a simple sketch on a
board or large piece of paper to illustrate the group’s
thinking.
q Reverse Thinking assigns group members opposite
views from their own for discussion purposes.
q Role-Play is the spontaneous acting out of a situation,
after which there is a discussion of situation context
and underlying feelings.
q Symposium/Discussion includes breaking a topic down
into parts, presented in brief speeches by members
of the group. After the speeches, a class discussion is
used.
q Seminars are best suited for small classes of 10-15
students and have small-group and individual-based
learning dimensions. Each student specializes in one
area of a broad subject. Reading is assigned, reports
are written, and students present their analysis to the
entire group. Copies of each paper often accompany
a presentation. The instructor serves as the “expert”
and guides discussion.

Effective Explorations

ow would you devise a series
of explorations of such a
simple yet so complex idea as the
relationship between matter and
energy? How could this concept be
studied using all seven ways of
knowing? Be sure to write your approaches into your lesson plans.

L

earning
explorations
should
be
personalized, exciting, and diverse so
that students can apply their learning skills most effectively
to the subject at hand. Therefore, the heart of any lesson is an
intelligent, creative offering of learning activities best suited to
producing the learning objectives you specify and making the
learning personal to each student. In short, you need a variety of
ways to help learners explore each topic for themselves.
In addition, planning for a variety of exploration activities is beneficial because each requires the use of different cognitive or thinking abilities, often referred to as “ways
of knowing” (Lazear, 1991). Exploration activities usually
concentrate or accentuate one or more ways of knowing.
The eight ways of knowing are :
q Verbal/linguistic, encompassing written and spoken
words, memory, and recall.
q Logical/mathematical, knowing includes reasoning,
abstractions, and relationships.
q Visual/spatial, including acute visualization, mental
imagining, graphics, and manipulation of space.
q Body/kinesthetic, relating to bodily movement and
mime activities.
q Musical/rhythmic, entailing sensitivity to sounds,
tones, and rhythms.
q Interpersonal, encompassing effectiveness in interpersonal and group verbal and nonverbal communication.
q Intrapersonal, involving a sense of self, awareness of

feelings, and the ability to concentrate.
q Naturalist, understands nature, relates to collecting,
categorizing things and studying plant parts.
Here are some quick ideas to jog your learning exploration
creativity:
q Read a speech and analyze its reasoning in a minipaper or small-group discussion.
q View a video of the speech and analyze its influence
on your thinking and attitude; then identify the key
images, messages, and sounds that made the most
lasting impression and explain why.
q Discuss in small groups the relationship between
the structural elements of a movie clip; listen for the
actors’ vocal rhythm patterns; mark sections that contained key body movements supporting or detracting
from the character’s message; explore congruency of
verbal and nonverbal messages in different passages.
q Evaluate the effectiveness of a media clip.
q Ask each small group to quickly create an ad in 10 minutes that attempts to sell a specific point of view of
a controversial issue just presented in a lecture; then
have each group act out the ad while the other groups
analyze the message and identify its point of view.
Compare original intent with actual perception.

earning can indeed be accelerated by a range of fascinating techniques. Creating A+
Lesson Plans is an important
first step to making time spent
on learning more efficient and
enjoyable for you and your students. Beware of the nay sayers
who are convinced that it can’t
be done and therefore never try.

L

earning accelerators refer to the entire range
of resources that help students achieve lesson
objectives. These are not methods or techniques, but tools
chosen to clarify and simplify the content of a presentation,
activity, or lesson topic.
Today’s instructors aren’t expected to be the comprehensive
source of knowledge for their classes. You don’t have to know
everything there is to know about the body of knowledge that you
teach. However, you must decide how best to use the knowledge
resources available to you and your students. Knowledge resources
that teachers and students share in common are the textbook,
the institution’s library collection, public media, and the Internet.
Knowledge sources that are unique to you are your education,
work, and life experiences. Likewise, students bring their previous
education, work, and life experiences to their current learning
endeavors. Part of building an A+ Lesson Plan is selecting the most
effective set of knowledge resources available to make learning as
rapid, memorable, and meaningful as possible.
Osborn and Osborn (2000, p.247) observe that “presentation
aids [visual, audio, and concrete objects] give your audience sensory
contact with your message—words simply represent objects and
ideas.” Modifying a phrase on a board to demonstrate alliteration
or playing a selection of bluegrass music to demonstrate the
contribution of a mandolin are richer learning experiences than
hearing a verbal explanation alone. Osborn and Osborn (2000,
p.248) noted these benefits, in particular:

“Presentation aids enhance understanding; they are better
than words at conveying meaning. Presentation aids add variety
to sustain interest and attention.” In addition, aids can create
a lasting impression and assist recall. As shortcuts to better
learning, these materials can make long, complicated explanations
unnecessary.
Choosing good aids will accelerate learning for your students
because these materials involve more of the students’ senses
and intelligences in the learning process. And anything that
accelerates learning is well worth the time and effort that goes
into the selection, preparation, and display of these materials.
So the bottom line here is to analyze each learning objective
you create to see if there are one or more aids that could
accelerate learning. If you decide there are materials available,
describe the aid you will need in your lesson plan. Having each
aid listed will jog your memory as you review your lesson plan
before each class.
Types of learning aids
With the wonderful variety of media equipment and
information resources available today, you have the rather fun
and pleasurable job of matching learning aids to the learning task

at hand. Being able to see, hear, smell, feel, and manipulate an
object speeds learning. Let’s look at a brief list of the common
learning aids used to enhance the Input and Exploration phases
of a lesson.
Live Demonstration: Instructor demonstration of a process,
action, procedure, or object can be a simple yet powerful
instructional methodology. Our brains are naturally hot-wired
to learn from watching others do things; sounds, colors, odors,
textures, stimulate the senses and provide memory links.
3-D Models: These work well as presentation aids when the
object is too large, rare, dangerous, valuable, or fragile to have
in the classroom. Or, a live model may be appropriate when the
subject is a study of movement, as in sports, dance and acting.
2-D Graphic Presentation Aids: include maps, charts, sketches,
and graphs. Maps illustrate movements, boundaries, and
relationships. Charts illustrate organizational hierarchy, steps
in a process, periods, or visual representations of a projection.
Sketches are useful when simplified representations are sufficient.
Finally, graphs illustrate proportions or relationships.
White boards: The modern chalkboard is best suited for
brief writing of crucial phrases, terms, equations, formulae, and
sketches. Information requiring more time to present is best
presented using another medium perhaps computer projection.
Caution: while writing or drawing, turn periodically and talk with
eye contact to your students, not the board.
Flip charts: Although low-tech, they are quick, easy to prepare,
use, and modify on the fly while teaching. Complex concepts can
also be presented using a series of flip-chart pages. In combination
with an easel, flip charts are particularly useful when a class meets
in a remote location that does not have Internet access or media
equipment available.

Presentation Projectors: The modern equivalent of the old
slide and overhead projectors. These projectors are great for
displaying videos, images or computer data on a screen or other
flat surface. Entire presentations can be created and stored on a
flash drive, and shown on stand alone projector system. Caution:
repetitive use of PowerPoint type slide presentations can reduce
their effectiveness as a learning tool.
Smart Boards (Electronic White Board) Interfaced with a
computer and Internet, you can write notes, draw, manipulate
images, etc., save electronically, print or email to students.
Audio Clips and Podcasts: Easy to store and use, MP3 audio
files and players provide the means to examine sounds or
patterns, hear famous speeches, interviews, music and natural
and computer-generated sounds. Faculty can easily record
lectures and make them available as podcasts.
Computer-assisted Presentations: These require a range of
computer skills to produce and may require extensive time and
resources to complete, or they may consist of internet videos
and flash animations easily downloaded and ready to use in a
class presentation. You can Google Video titles or search for
appropriates clips on YouTube. Computer-assisted presentations
do, however, offer great flexibility and teaching power especially
in technology, health, science, math, and engineering courses.
Sometimes the most overlooked learning opportunity comes
at the end of each class session. Research shows recall peaks at
this time. What can you do to take advantage of this fact? The
next chapter will give you a unique idea worth remembering.

Clinging to the Cliff

S

peeches and class sessions should not end flatly
with a “That’s all, folks,” or “I’m done for today.”
Studies prove that retention actually goes up at the end of
the class session. The beginning and end times of a lesson are
extremely valuable in terms of learning and recall, so plan the
end of each lesson with positive intention and thoughtful strategy. Next, let’s look at some effective ways to end a lesson including our personal favorite, the Cliff Hanger.
Summarize, connect, apply
Summarize the main points of the lesson. Connect the lesson
just concluded with the next lesson by pointing out relationships
and an application to a real-world problem.
Short and simple
Your final words should stay with the students, and remind
them of their next assignment. Planning a lasting impression can
supply a sense of closure. Here are some tips:
q Stories reinforce and are often remembered long
after facts are forgotten.
q Quotations capture the essence of your message.
q Rhetorical questions invite further thought.
q Challenge the students to apply the day’s lesson.

T

he beginning and end
times of a lesson are extremely valuable in terms of
learning and recall; so, let’s look
at some effective ways to end a
lesson which include my personal favorite, the Cliff Hanger.

Brings ’em back every time
Here’s a novel idea that won first prize in a Teaching For Success
Super Ideas Contest. It was written by Howard Rosenthal, Ed D,
a professor and Human Services program coordinator, St. Louis
Community College at Florissant, St. Louis in Missouri. This idea
was first published in Teaching For Success, August 2001 edition.
Dr. Rosenthal explains how to keep attendance high with his
unique and very effective class-closing method.
The impetus to share this highly effective technique dawned on me after an unusually bright student
approached me. I had just completed my last class on
a Friday and my student said, “Darn it. You did it to us
again.”
“Did what?” I asked with total sincerity.
“You always leave us with some sort of cliff-hanger
lecture or class experience that intrigues us so that we
have to come back to the next class.
“It’s sort of like when you go to a movie and you
don’t want leave before the ending. Now I’ll need to
wait the entire weekend to find out what happens.”
I merely smiled.
Many teachers do roughly the opposite of what I
am going to suggest herein. For example, an instructor might end a typical lecture with, “Okay, now that

I’ve covered the material related to World War I, I’ll
begin talking about World War II in our next class.”
While this strategy is certainly acceptable, I believe
that you can often generate massive motivation by
not giving your students the punch line until the next
class period. This is no small feat in terms of today’s
problems with class retention and attendance.
Newscasters routinely use this strategy. Here are
some of the cliff-hanger statements that I heard as I
watched my local news last evening: “If you think that
eating fruits and vegetables is healthy just wait until
you hear the results of an amazing new study.”
Of course, a commercial break follows that statement. (Yes, I’m not immune to the powers of this strategy, hence, I stayed tuned like I’m certain thousands of
other viewers—many of whom are students—did!)
The final words I encountered prior to the next
commercial were, “Don’t even think about heading out to the ballpark until you hear what Sam the
weatherman says is in store for us tonight.”
Here are just a few actual examples of cliff-hangers
that I’ve used recently:
 When you return on Monday, I’m going to tell
you precisely how one of our students was able to
snare a salary that was over $6,000 a year higher
than what was advertised in the paper.
 Next time we meet I’m going to tell you about an
extraordinary discovery that suggests that Freud
changed his entire theory so he would be accepted
by his colleagues.

The most powerful cliff-hangers are those that personally affect the student (e.g., the salary or the testing), though to be sure, this is not always possible.
End your class with a cliff-hanger and watch your
attendance soar.

L

earning should be and, yes, must be exciting, like discovering the sights, sounds,
and smells of a new city. The landscape of any subject holds fascination for the
learner, and it’s up to the innovative instructor to unlock the doors to the enjoyment of new learning for as many students as possible.

valuation is a major part of each
lesson plan. Be sure to identify
assessment measures you can use to gauge student achievement
of the lesson objective(s). Assessment measures may be tests,
papers, projects, performances, class participation, etc. Choice
of an assessment measure is best accomplished by linking each
measure to a lesson objective.
Remember, a lesson objective points to a thinking skill level
the student should attain. Bloom observed that objectives relating to content mastery are not all on the same level.
As you recall from Chapter Three, objectives based on knowledge range from an elementary level (recall words, facts, dates,
etc.) to the most complex level, evaluation (making critical judgements based on internal and external criteria). The words chosen
to identify the behavior in each objective suggest the level of
knowledge required and the appropriate assessment measure.
The ability to list, identify, or define relates to the most elementary and concrete thinking levels. Be sure to go beyond these
levels. Tests or performance challenges that ask the students to
discriminate among causes or specific results or to combine, justify, or criticize a concept, process, or principle should be included
and are the most appropriate assessment measures to check for
critical thinking.
As an instructor, you are accountable for achieving the teaching
and learning outcomes you accept as reasonable goals. To achieve
this you will need to evaluate your progress continually, as well as
that of your students. Be sure to build this strategy into your plans.

he more time you spend on lesson preparation the first time you design and
teach a course, the less preparation time you will need to teach
the same course in the future. With the basic lessons, in place
your preparation time can be devoted to lesson improvement.
Depending on the number of course hours, complete plans
can range from 12 to 24 pages for a one-hour-per-week course
and 30 to 60 pages for a three- to four-hour-per-week course.
Store your plans either in a three-ring binder or in a common
and easy-to-read computer document format, such as MS Word
or Adobe Acrobat, in a public access folder on your computer.
Your plans should be easy to locate so that in the event you
cannot continue teaching the course, you can provide the new
instructor with a set of your plans to make the process of taking
over for you easier.
