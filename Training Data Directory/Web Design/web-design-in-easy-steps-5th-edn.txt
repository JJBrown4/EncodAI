Layout and Design

Your layout needs to
communicate order and
consistency, so the design
looks professional and is
easy to use. The fonts, colors,
textures and images you
choose will combine to create
the look and feel of your

Layout and Design

The Role of Your Design
The layout and design
guidelines in this chapter
are just that: guidelines.
Feel free to break them
creatively. Just take care
that you don’t break
them without thinking
about them first.

Now that you’ve spent some time planning and creating content,
it’s time to look at the layout and design of your web pages. Your
website design needs to achieve the following goals:
engagement. Your website design needs to
• Encourage
inspire visitors to look around your site and spend some

time there. It’s easy to focus on this aspect of the design,
but don’t get carried away. Keep the purpose of your site in
mind throughout its development, otherwise you might end
up with something that is beautiful, but otherwise useless.
Different styles will resonate with different audiences, which
is why it’s important to understand your target visitors first.

order. Whether you have five pages or five

Don’t be afraid to leave
some empty space, at
the bottom of a column,
for example. It gives your
design breathing space.
You don’t have to fill
every inch of your page
with content or design
elements.

Use whatever tools you
find easiest. You could
start with pen and paper,
use an art package like
Adobe Photoshop, or go
straight into an HTML
prototype. The key is
to experiment and not
become wedded to
any particular design or
layout too early.

to understand which pages are more important, and which
parts of each page are most important.

the boundaries of the website. Because people can

move between websites so easily, it’s important that they

understand when this has happened. Using a consistent
design across your web pages helps to reassure visitors that
they are still on your website. You can create different layouts
for different page types (your homepage and product pages
are bound to look different, for example), but these should
share the same design elements. Avoid using radically
different color schemes or graphic styles on different pages,
otherwise visitors might think they’ve gone to a different
website. Anything that makes the visitor think about using
your website, instead of just getting on with doing so, is a
barrier to your site achieving its goals.

easy-to-use. Your site navigation needs to feel intuitive

to spend time using your content, not trying to figure out
how to find it. Navigation is so important that Chapter 5 is
dedicated to it.

confidence. If you have a site that visitors consider
• Inspire
to be professionally designed, they’re more likely to come

back or spend money with you. People will (sometimes
subconsciously) judge the quality of your expertise or services
based on how professional your website looks.

Fixed or Flexible?
One of the challenges of website design is that you don’t know
how large the user’s web browser window will be. Screen sizes
vary greatly, and people often resize their browser window so that
they can see more than one application on screen, side by side.
The website design is typically contained in a box on the screen (a
container box). Sometimes this box has no border, so it’s invisible.
But how the size of that box is defined governs what happens to
the whole web page, at different screen and window sizes. There
are several common strategies for dealing with the uncertainty of
different screen and window sizes.

Fixed width design

Fixed width is perhaps the most popular solution to the challenge
of different screen sizes. In a fixed width design, the container box
has a width that is always the same size. This gives the designer
the most control over the look of the final web page, so it makes
it easier to create pages that consistently look good.

On a smaller screen, there is
less white space at the sides,
and less of the page’s height
is visible at once. But the core
design is preserved, and the web
designer remains in control. The
Guardian (www.guardian.co.uk)
has built one of the many sites
that use this strategy.
Above: The Guardian
website on a narrow
monitor.
Left: The Guardian
website on a wide
monitor.

If you already have a
website, use your web
analytics to measure
the screen resolution
your visitors have. The
global trends in screen
size are less important
than what your audience
actually uses. Websites
that cater for corporate
or public sector markets
could find screen sizes
lag considerably behind
the web population, as a
whole.

51

It takes control away from users, though. If they shrink the
browser window, they might have to scroll horizontally as well
as vertically to see everything, which is annoying. Users with big
screens see the website at a smaller size than their screen could
display, but the content remains easy to navigate and read.

How wide should your
fixed width design be?
W3Counter (www.
w3counter.com/
gloabstats.php) publishes
screen resolution data
based on visitors to over
40,000 websites. In
September 2010, only
2.2% of people still used
800x600 screens. Most
had at least 1024x768
resolution. Designers
often use a fixed width
of 960 pixels, which
leaves space for the
scrollbar and other
browser features. 960 is
also easily divisible into
columns.

Layout and Design

...cont’d
Flexible design
The subscription service
Adobe CS Live includes
SiteCatalyst Netaverages.
This provides current
data on the browsers
and devices people are
using to view websites,
and the latest trends.

In a flexible design, the website design stretches or shrinks to the
size of the browser window.
This strategy reduces the amount of scrolling users have to do,
because the content can make optimal use of the screen space
available. You can combine a flexible design with a maximum
width, so that the site scales down for smaller screens and
windows, but doesn’t become too wide to read comfortably
on large monitors. Flexible design is hard to do well, because
everybody sees a different amount of content on screen depending
on the size of their monitor and/or browser window.

52

The Broads Authority (www.broads-authority.gov.uk) uses a
flexible design with a maximum width. The content columns
expand to use the available space, but the maximum width stops
them from becoming too wide.

The browser does all the
hard work in putting
things in the right place.
You just need to say
how wide you want your
website content box
to be: a fixed width in
pixels, a percentage of
the available space, or a
size relative to the text
size (using the em unit).

Another strategy is to
use an elastic design,
which stretches in
proportion to the size of
the text. That means the
length of lines of text
remains constant, so you
can ensure they remain
easy to read.

Variable content design

Some sites show additional content to users who have larger
screens. This needs to be non-essential bonus content, because
not everyone will see it. Amazon is a good example of this. Its
main books page, for example, expands horizontally to show more
books when viewed on a wider screen.

Using the Grid
Web designers often use a grid to help them position content on
screen, within the container box.
Grids are routinely used for designing print products. Newspapers,
for example, use column-based layouts. Sometimes, a headline
or a picture might span two, three or four columns. But it rarely
spans two and a half columns, because that tends to look messy.
Whether you’re working in print or online, if you can line up
blocks of content, it makes your design look tidier.
Take a look at the website for the Drupal content management
system (www.drupal.org). The grey stripes have been overlaid to
show the 12 column grid that is the foundation of this design.

The free 960 Grid System
(www.960.gs), developed
by Nathan Smith,
provides CSS templates
you can use to help build
your grid-based layout.
It also includes sketch
sheets you can print out
to help you plan a 12,
16 or 24 column design.

Not everything
has to sit rigidly
on the grid: you
can break out of
it for emphasis,
and to create
some pace in the
design. But, if
nothing lines up,
a web page can
look amateurish
or chaotic.

53

The top blue section is divided into two halves. The first white
section contains three boxes, all aligned to the same grid. Some
of the content within these boxes is centered, but most of it sits
tightly against the edge of the column. Towards the bottom of
the page, the design is two-column again, and aligned to the same
grid. Notice how well all the content on the left is aligned, from
the logo down to the footer links.

To stop the design
looking too blocky, don’t
put a border around all
your content boxes. You
can also use curves in
your design, like Orion
Advisor Services (www.
orionadvisor.com).

Tips for Good Alignment
To ensure your web page lines up well, follow these steps:

l

l

54

2

Above: The rule of thirds
says that designs based
on dividing things into
thirds look harmonious.
The website of singer
and songwriter Lily Allen
(www.lilyallenmusic.
com) uses three equally
big columns on the
homepage, and a twothirds / one-third layout
on content pages.

Right: The inconsistent
alignment and centeraligned text looks messy.
Far right: The pictures
line up with each other,
the text above and the
company name. The
left-aligned main text
looks cleaner. The footer
is right-aligned with the
right-margin of the main
content box. This is far
from a complete web
design, but it does show
the difference good
alignment makes.

l

l
4

Mark up your content correctly, using the right HTML
tags, to identify a heading or a list item, for example.
By default, HTML brings consistency, ensuring that all
headlines and bullets line up. You’ll learn more about
HTML in Chapter 6.
Take care when adding spacing using CSS (changing
the padding and margin around an element). This can
introduce inconsistencies that throw out the natural
alignment that HTML gives you. You’ll learn how to
control spacing using CSS in Chapter 7.
Be careful if you’re using a visual editing system to build
your web pages. They will often let you place content
wherever you want on the page, but won’t alert you if
you’re a few pixels out in lining things up. That can lead
to designs that look sloppy.
It’s easier to create a strong alignment, and the impression
of good design that goes with it, if you align content with
the left or right edge of the page or content box. If you
center content, the alignment is harder to see. Centered
paragraphs are also harder to read, because the start of
each line is harder to find. Newcomers often want to
center everything, but you should limit your use of center
alignment to a few carefully selected parts of your design.

Thinking Above the Fold
As well as column based layouts, there’s another idea the web has
borrowed from the newspaper industry: the fold.
When broadsheet newspapers are laid out for sale, they’re folded
down the middle and only the top half can be seen. The bit that’s
on show is said to be “above the fold”. Newspapers are designed
to have their major headlines and photos in this top half of the
page, so that people are drawn to them and pick up the paper. The
newspaper’s branding also appears prominently in this top half, so
that people can recognise it immediately.
In web design, the term “above the fold” is used to refer to the
first screenful of content. It’s what people can see without having
to scroll the page, so it is their first impression of your website.
It’s essential that your website’s identity or branding, and its
navigation, appears above the fold. By having multiple columns
of text, you can also start several different stories above the fold
and invite people to click to read more or scroll down the page to
finish reading.

Avoid having deep
pages that require too
much scrolling. Consider
splitting a long article
into lots of shorter
articles. It’s easier to
navigate, and can help
your search rankings,
too.

55

Of course, the fold doesn’t appear at the same place for everyone.
It varies depending on the screen resolution, browser used, and the
number of browser toolbars in use. If you’re assuming a minimum
screen height of 768 pixels, a good place to think of the fold is
being 575-590 pixels down the page. But remember that this is the
minimum and that people will see lots of different sized screenfuls.
People don’t always notice the scrollbar, so you need to provide a
visual cue to encourage people to scroll down the page. An easy
way to do this is to box some of the content, and stagger where
the boxes end. People will understand that if they can’t see the
bottom border of the box, they haven’t seen everything.
Far left: The user has
no clue that this page
continues below the fold
(the red line).
Left: Boxing the left
column tells the
user the web page
continues below the
fold, prompting them to
scroll.

Layout and Design

Organizing Information

56

Make your navigation
stand out. Use color, text
size, or spacing to make
it immediately obvious
to visitors. While your
text and other content
has to be there, most of
the time, people are just
skim-reading it to find
the next link they need.

Proximity helps
communicate meaning.
Don’t put half your
navigation links on
the left and half on
the right: they belong
together. Make sure your
headings are closer to
the content they title,
rather than the content
above.

People ignore things
they think are adverts.
So don’t make your
content or navigation
look the same size and
shape as an advert (see
Chapter 15 for standard
advert sizes). Take
care with positioning
important content on
the right, too. Adverts
are often placed here, so
content there might be
more easily overlooked.

Within each web page, you need to create a hierarchy of
information. It needs to be easy for visitors to see what’s most
important on any given page, and easy for them to skim-read the
page to find what they’re looking for.
Think of it like a newspaper. The size of the headlines, and their
position on the page, tells you a lot about the relative importance
of different stories.
Here are some tips for organizing the content on your web page:

• Larger text looks more important than smaller text.
Things higher up the page tend to be more important than
• things
further down the page.
Be consistent. If you have 20 different sizes of text, it will be
• difficult
for people to gauge their relative importance. Use

up to three different types of headings which are consistently
formatted. Using the HTML <h1> to <h3> tags correctly will
enforce consistency by default.

Use bulleted lists and subheadings to structure your content.
• You
can create them using HTML, so they’re part of the
language of navigating the web.

You can use contrasting color or spacing around elements to
• call
attention to them. Audiobook company Audible (www.

audible.com), for example, could use a text link that says
“continue” to bring people into its subscription process. But
it uses a bright orange button with space around it, so that
there’s no mistaking the most important action on this page.

Creating a Color Scheme
The typical computer can display millions of colors, so how do
you choose a handful that work well? The good news is that
there are lots of tools that encapsulate the important color design
theories, and they’re often free. Here’s a suggested approach:

l
1

2

Open a color scheme tool. You can find one at
www.colorschemedesigner.com, and Adobe has one called
Kuler at http://kuler.adobe.com. You might have one built
in to your web design software or image editing software
too.

Above: The CoffeeCup
HTML Editor includes a
color scheme creator.

You can often change
the personality of your
palette by using tints and
shades instead of the
pure color. You get a tint
when you add white to
a color. You get a shade
when you add black to a
color. A monochromatic
color scheme consists
solely of tints and shades
of one color, like a sepia
photograph.

Although the color
wheels make it easy and
fun to create a color
scheme, they encapsulate
important design
theories. If you just make
up your own set of
colors, without reference
to the color wheel,
there’s a good chance
they’ll clash.

57

l

Think of a starting color. You could take it from your
company logo, your favorite color, or from the association
of a color with a particular meaning or mood. Red spells
danger or romance, green references nature, and blue
communicates stability, for example. If you have an image
that will be a prominent part of your design, you could
take the color
from that. The
pipette tool in
Photoshop can
be used to grab
a color from a
photo, so you
can find out
its RGB color
number.

Layout and Design

...cont’d

58

Above: Contrast-A, by
Das Plankton, offers
much more in-depth
analysis of contrast. It’s
free to use at http://
www.dasplankton.de/
ContrastA/ and can
also be downloaded for
free from the Adobe
Marketplace.

Don’t be afraid to use
black on white for large
areas of text. It offers
the best contrast, so it’s
easy to read. Most of the
major websites (including
search engines, news
sites, shops, and social
networks) use black text
on a white background
for their core content.

Right: The Color Contrast
Checker helps you make
sure your foreground
and background
colors make a legible
combination.

l
l
3

Choose your starting color. You usually do this by clicking
it on a color wheel. Using Kuler, you can also type in a
hex value of the color or its RGB value.

4

Choose what type of color scheme you would like to
create. You have several options here. A monochromatic
scheme uses shades of one color. A complementary
scheme uses two colors that are directly opposite each
other on the color wheel. A triad uses three colors that
are the same distance apart on the wheel. There’s also a
split complement triad, which uses one color, and the
two colors beside its complement on the other side of the
wheel. An analogous color scheme uses colors that are
next to each other on the color wheel. Experiment to see
what works well for you.

l
l
5

Note the color numbers in the palette provided. You’ll
need to put them in your CSS code later.

6

To make sure that your site is easy for everyone to read,
it’s important to make sure there is enough contrast
between your foreground and background colors.
Take a screengrab of your color combination (text on
background) and then use an art package to make it
grayscale, to see how legible it is. Alternatively, enter your
colors into the Color Contrast Check at http://snook.
ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html. It will tell you
whether your colors comply with accessibility guidelines.

Using Gradients
Solid blocks of color can be overwhelming, if the color is a warm
one like red or yellow, or might just look a bit flat if not. That’s
why websites often use a gradient instead, where one color fades
into another. The easiest way to do this is to create a background
image that represents part of the gradient, and then repeat it.
For example, this stripe of color:

is set as a repeating background on the website for web surfing
game Wild Mood Swings (www.wildmoodswings.co.uk), like this:

You can also put
an image in the
background, to add
texture to your page.
You could use a photo
of wood or a wall, or
something more subtle,
like sand. Carbon
offsetting company
Carbonica (www.
carbonica.org) uses a
photo of brown paper
in the background, to
complement the cloth
texture in its design.

59

You can use a gradient to
soften any area of color,
however big it is. You could
apply a gradient image as the
background to a button, to
give it a 3D look that makes
it stand out.
Fresh Books (www.
freshbooks.com) uses a
gradient on its navigation
tab and its button, as well
as in its blue background.
Central Snowsports (www.
centralsnowsports.com.
au) uses gradients in its
predominantly pink design, to
create a sense of texture.

The design gains a
sense of unity when
a few well-selected
colors are repeated
throughout the design.
Fresh Books uses the
same contrasting green
color to call attention to
its navigation tab and
its pricing button, for
example. The site could

Choosing Fonts

60

Don’t get carried
away with fancy fonts:
remember the most
important thing is that
people can comfortably
read your message.

See Chapter 7 for details
of which fonts are safe
to use in your content,
and advice on using CSS
to style your web page
content.

If you specify very
different fonts, test your
website to see how it
displays with each of
them. Sometimes the
spacing of text changes
significantly when
different fonts are used.

The style of text you use on your website has a huge impact on its
design. Some fonts are playful, some are business-like; some speak
of tradition, while others look futuristic. All this information is
conveyed before somebody has even read what the text says.
You should use fonts that convey the personality of your site,
where possible, although there are lots of technical limitations on
this. When the web browser displays text, it uses the fonts on the
visitor’s PC. That means you’re limited to a relatively small set of
safe fonts if you want everyone to see the same thing.
However, you can give the
browser a list of font options,
so you could request a daring
and relatively rare font and give
the browser a safe substitute
if that font isn’t available. You
could use a font that comes
with Adobe Creative Suite or
Microsoft Office, for people
who have those packages, for
example, and declare a basic
font that comes with the
operating system, as a back-up.
For small pieces of text, such
as a headline, you could create
a picture that shows the text
and put that in your web page.
That approach is always used
for logos, and could also be used for small headlines, but it should
be used selectively. It makes your web page slower to load, creates
a lot of work for you, in building and editing the site, and makes
it harder for search engines and users of assistive technology to
understand your content. If you’re using Flash, you can embed
a font in your Flash file, too, so you can send the font over the
internet with your content.
Pay attention to the size of the text and its color. Some fonts look
good at larger sizes but not at smaller, and vice versa. You can use
color to change how heavy the font looks on screen, too. A big
blocky font can be softened by changing its color from black to
blue, for example.

What is Your Look and Feel?
The look and feel of your website is what results from all the
decisions you make about its content and design.
It is a combination of:

The images you use. Both the style of your content images
• and
photography, and the choice and arrangement of any
decorative images.

• The attitude suggested by your text, and the language it uses.
• The color scheme you have chosen.
The fonts you use to convey your information and draw
• attention
to important elements.
way you arrange elements on the page to accentuate what
• isTheimportant.

Using design elements consistently sends a signal to your visitors
that you’ve paid attention to the details. It’s easy to put things
onto a screen. It takes more care to combine them so that they
look like they belong together in a single design. Work within a
palette of four or five colors (plus shades or tints, as appropriate).
Make the spacing between different elements on your web page
consistent. Choose one or two fonts and use them throughout.
The rule of thumb is that, if things look similar, they should be
exactly the same. If they’re nearly the same, it just looks sloppy. If
you don’t want things to look the same, then make them radically
different. Leave no doubt that you have deviated from the norm
to add contrast or emphasis, or to call attention to them.
When you’re developing the elements of your look and feel,
keep your intended audience in mind. Think about the kinds of
magazines they read, the TV shows they might watch, the films
they prefer, and their favorite websites (until yours is built, at
least). Use a visual language that will make them feel at home.

61

You need all these elements to work in harmony. If you were
promoting an industrial rock band and had lots of metallic
textured images, it would look strange to have a fancy handwritten
font, or lots of bright kid-friendly colors. Sometimes you can
subvert conventional wisdom, but it’s usually better to play it safe.

Professionals often
create the look and feel
in an art package, like
Photoshop. They make
an image of the whole
web page. This image
can then be sliced up to
make the background
and foreground images
that will form part of the
finished website.

Layout and Design

62

The Right Look and Feel
Don’t let brand
guidelines constrain
you into creating a
poor web experience.
Sometimes there’s a
conflict between a
company’s brand and
what works well on the
web. Large companies
often revise their offline
brand guidelines, for
consistency with the
website, rather than
forcing the web to
adopt a style that was
developed for print.
Many companies believe
the most important
thing is that the website
offers a consistent
experience that is an
extension of the brand,
and not necessarily that
it replicates the printed
materials.

I’ve chosen obviously
contrasting examples
here, but you can see
that if you swapped the
design of these websites
around, their audiences
would be repelled.
You don’t have to use
guesswork. You can
invite members of your
audience to give you
feedback on every stage
of your design.

To understand the importance of the look and feel, let’s take a
look at three websites that cater for different audiences.
Saga (www.saga.co.uk) offers services, including insurance and
holidays, to the over 50s. The homepage is clear and easy to
navigate but offers lots of options. It’s designed to work on an
older computer with an 800x600 screen and has an option to
enlarge the text.
The Mr Men website (www.mrmen.com/uk) is designed for
children to use by themselves. There are few navigation options,
which are shown using bold icons. The color palette is bold and
exciting, and Flash animation is used to bring the characters to
life. A voice tells children what the buttons mean when they roll
the mouse over them.
The website for heavy rock magazine Metal Hammer (www.
metalhammer.co.uk) has a gritty and dirty look to it, with paint
and blood splattered in the background. It reflects the look of the
magazine and the aesthetics of heavy metal album artwork.
