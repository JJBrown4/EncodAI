Discover why now is the time to
start building your first website

T

he web made its debut back in 1991,
adding a graphical user interface to the
internet. As such, web design was born.
In its infancy, web design was heavily restricted by
technology and hardware, with a web presence
being little more than black text on a white
background. Thankfully, technology and web
design have reached a far more creative and
imaginative stage in their evolutions. Skipping past
frames, tables and animated GIFs, web design has
become far more sophisticated and will continue
to grow and develop. Look back a couple of years
and take note of what was ‘on trend’ and how the
underlying infrastructure helped shape a website.
The progression of web design has always gone
hand-in-hand with technology, and technology
never takes a backward step, which in turn means

that web design and the web are always going to
be informative, inspirational and essential.
Think about what you use the web for and how
you would achieve these tasks without it. In the
couple of decades that the web has been around
it’s gone from a plain text, email-checking entity
to the key communication and information tool of
governments, businesses and individuals. And, what
is it that makes the web such a crucial tool? Web
pages and websites. Whatever information, service
or product you need it will be wrapped up in a web
page just waiting for you to say hello.

Why build a website?
It’s a simple question, but why build a website?
There is no single answer to what is undoubtedly a
very broad question. However, the answer could

WorldMags.net

Web Design for Beginners 9

Essential

WorldMags.net
be something as simple as ‘because everyone
else has got one’. And, to a certain extent, this
simple answer reaches the crux of the matter
very succinctly. The world wide web is a global
phenomenon that’s awash with millions, if not
billions, of websites covering every subject you can
possibly imagine. There is no better place to be
seen and get your message heard. A website can be
viewed from England to Australia, while astronauts
have even tweeted from the International Space
Station! A 24/7 online global presence is one very
powerful reason to build a website.

it also acts as a reference point or calling card,
where a user can promote themselves. If it’s not
a personal platform for opinion and promotion a
site can be great a way to stay in contact and tell
friends and family what you’re up to. An online
diary can include the latest activities and a host of
photos, much like a personal Facebook. This could
be another reason, for those not interested in being
part of the Facebook revolution, and want greater
control, then a personal site is a great alternative.
The web also provides the perfect platform for
those looking to build a business. The outlay is

“Websites cover every aspect of life,
whether it’s personal or business”
There is no doubt that websites cover every
aspect of life, whether it’s personal or business.
On a personal level, everyone has an interest or
hobby that they love and many simply want to tell
the world what they do. A website is the perfect
platform for getting across personal opinion and

minimal and the potential audience is huge. No
need to rent premises, no need to keep a huge
pile of stock, and customers will come from miles
around to pay a visit. Provide the right product,
promote in the right way and the number of visits
will shoot through the roof.

What are HTML & CSS?
HTML and CSS are the key components for building web pages and sites – without them the web as
we know it simply would not exist. In a nutshell, HTML provides the building blocks and structure while
CSS provides the styling.
HTML is made up of a whole host of tags which all have their own identity. These consist of an
opening and closing tag with all the relevant content in between. For example, ‘<header>web page
content goes here</header>’. HTML defines a whole series of tags, for example header, nav, footer,
video, etc, which all have a semantic title making them easy to identify. Custom tags, or div tags as
they are known, are created when a standard HTML tag cannot be used. Again these have their own
individual identities. CSS is the language applied to an HTML tag to style it. Cascading Style Sheets, CSS,
will take the name of
a HTML tag, <header>
and define properties
such as its height,
width, colour, borders,
padding and margins
for example. CSS3 now
offers a completely new
generation of styling
options to use. Rounder
corners, text shadows,
box shadows and
gradients are just a few
of the properties styling
today’s websites.

HTML5 is the web language you need to
learn to build a site from scratch

Combine HTML5
and CSS3 to create
interactive and
standout websites

Beyond personal opinion and comment, a
website can have a more commercial use. Web
designers instantly have the perfect platform for
presenting their work. What better reason does a
web designer need to build a website? A portfolio
site is a great shop window for their work and a
constant point of reference, allowing web users
to visit at any time of day or night. As already
mentioned, if you’re looking to build a business
the web is a great starting point. A report from
www.eMarketer.com shows that 150 million
users across the United States are buying online.
This is a staggering 73 per cent of all web users
demonstrating exactly how important an online
business could be. Another interesting snippet
of information reinforced in the report was that
people like to shop online for convenience and to
save money.
An online shop is the most probable and popular
purpose for business, but another and less obvious
reason is affiliate marketing. This is a website
specifically set up to promote affiliate products,
where money is made via commission.

What are websites used for?

The internet is very much influenced by what is
happening outside of the web. Remember it’s
people that build websites and people always want
information, people always need to go shopping,
people will always need to go to the bank,
people will always want to stay in contact – the
web provides the ideal platform to replace more
traditional services.
So what do people use websites for? In a nutshell:
pretty much everything! But to be more concise,
the purpose of a website is to relay a message or
offer a service. To get a more immediate picture
of what websites are used for, take a look at some
of the most popular sites on the web. Facebook,
YouTube, Google, Wikipedia, Twitter, Amazon,
iTunes, eBay, BBC, Sky, WordPress, PayPal, Skype,
Flickr, Walmart, Lastminute and Microsoft to name
but a few. This brief selection of sites pretty much
covers the spectrum of what websites are used
for. Facebook is a huge social networking site
and epitomises what people like to do on the
web – stay in contact and tell others what they are
up to. YouTube allows web users to stream and
watch videos from a vast library of variety. Sitting
along the same lines are services such as Netflix
and LoveFilm, which take the online streaming
and viewing experience to a new level. Google, a
service that nearly everyone in the world has heard
of, presents a different tool for the web, but search
engines are key to finding websites. Good luck if
you’re thinking of building a website to take on one
of the search giants!
The online encyclopaedia Wikipedia is a fountain
of knowledge. It’s one of the first online locations
web users will hit when looking for an answer to a

What makes
a good site?
A well-conceived website is not only
aesthetically pleasing, but also works
under the hood as well. Soul Media (www.
soulmedia.com.au) is a Melbourne-based
digital agency that has put together a striking
and well-constructed site that demonstrates
the traits of good design. The home page
makes an immediate impact with a big, bold
image and relays the company message
without too many distractions. The main
image is a background image that scales
with the browser window, ensuring that it
works with all screen sizes. The site is also
‘responsive’, which means that it responds
to the size of a screen and restyles to fit. This
ensures that a site will work for smartphones,
tablets and desktops.
The site itself uses the popular one-page
scrolling design. This negates the need to link
to other pages and wait for them to load. It is

“A responsive site
responds to the
size of a screen
and restyles to fit”
simply a matter of scrolling down the page
or using the fixed position menu to jump, in
an elegant manner, to the requested section.
The fixed nature of the navigation system
means that it is always visible and ready to use.
Alongside the HTML there is good use of web
fonts and CSS3 techniques – text shadows
and box shadows are all here in abundance.

Soul Media is a great example of web design
working in harmony for a great visual experience

Anatomy of a website
Websites by their very nature are made up of
a few constituent parts that are arranged in a
manner to suit the content. Typical websites are
either two- or three-column layouts with a header
and footer. What sets sites apart is the imagination
and variations used in the construction of the

constituent parts. Characteristically, the header of
a website appears at the top of the page, the
footer at the bottom of a page and the main
content in between.
Background images or colour will be used
to create a canvas for the page. This applies to

the best and worst of websites found on the
web. Take a look at your favourite site and it is
almost guaranteed to fit into the standard type
of template. The key to a great site is bringing all
the constituent parts together in a coherent and
cohesive manner that suits the content.

Logo
The logo is crucial,
its presents the site
brand and it is a key
navigation point. It
should always take
the user back to the
home page

Header
The top of the page
is prime real estate
on a web pages and
typically includes
the site logo and
the navigation
menu and
often advertising

Content
The main area of
any website is its
content. This will
typically appear
under the header
element and will be
arranged in a variety
of styles, such as
two columns, image
slider and
three columns

Image slider
A popular addition
to websites is an
image slider. This
allows for multiple
content to occupy
the same space.
Images, with text,
slide across to reveal
new content

Sidebar
Sidebars are
predominately
placed to the right,
as this makes the
content easier to
access, with less
mouse travel. A
sidebar can contain
an array of related
information and
interesting links

Footer
The footer, as its
name suggest,
resides at the
bottom of the page.
This typically offers
contact information,
links to social media
and a repeat of the
navigation menu

question. If Wikipedia doesn’t have the answer then
it will be a surprise. Again, this is a vast undertaking
and the knowledge base has been built up over
years by the general public, but it provides a great
blueprint for anyone looking to build a creditable
knowledge site.
Another big name on the web is Amazon, this
is one of the pioneers of the online shopping
experience and the site has developed to such
a level that it is often first in the queue when a
product needs to be purchased. A similar online
experience sits in the hands of eBay, this is an online
shopping experience, but users get to bid in an
online auction rather than buy a product at a fixed
price. The auction has a few imitators, but none
can match its capacity and completeness. The BBC
website covers a vast swathe of subjects, but it has
one primary, and very popular, purpose and that
is to bring the news to the masses. No matter if it’s
local news, international news or sports news, the
BBC will have it covered.

WordPress is the most popular web publishing
platform on the internet and provides the basis for
over a million websites. Typically seen as a blogging
platform, it has matured into something much
more complete. What it also provides is a brilliant
platform for people who want to produce their
own website without the degree or knowledge in
web design and development. Plus, it offers the
user more than just one incarnation of website;
almost any type of site (blog, ecommerce shop,
information-based and more) can be built from the
WordPress platform.
Sitting amongst the giants is Flickr, a photo
storage and sharing site that provides a platform
for professional photographers and amateurs alike.
The Flickr platform can act as a shop window or, in
the true spirit of the internet, act as a source where
images are freely available for others to use. When
it comes to music there are few that can match
the massive entity known as iTunes. The Applepowered store provides a shop front for a million

musicians and in turn allows for an intuitive online
buying experience.
The above does not cover every single use of a
website – for example, we’ve not mentioned online
banking – but it does offer a great representation of
the scope of purpose of exactly what a website
can achieve.

Where are websites stored?
The web to some degree is a mystical entity that
just exists out there somewhere, but obviously
this is not the case, all the information does have
a home. The web is part of the internet, which is
effectively a collection of connected computers
that create a mass of routes around the globe. This
provides the infrastructure for one computer to
connect to another and view any website that exists
on the web.
A web page is a file that is typically stored on a
local/home computer hard drive. A collection of
web pages becomes a website. However, before

What makes a good blog or
social website?
Blog sites can be bland and boring. But there are hundreds, if not thousands, of blogs that have
stepped outside the standard template to bring a splash of creativity and originality. Ultranoir (www.
ultranoir.com) is an award-winning Parisian creative agency that has taken the blog format and
created a striking and unique design. The Ultranoir blog, known as Blackstage, is a simple selection
of posts, but the combination of fonts, typography, images, layout and effects make the blog a
compelling, imaginative and engaging presence. The bespoke layout makes an immediate impression.
The two-column arrangement does not simply stack post on top of post, but uses a combination of
post sizes in a grid type layout to emphasise specific posts. The arrangement of individual posts does
not stick to a rigid format, again offering bespoke arrangements. There are posts with images, without
images, with intro text, without intro text and different size title text. The arrangement of the text and
the different weights make it ultimately readable. To finish, it adds a few clever dynamic touches, with
a 3D effect on post boxes, on mouse hover and moving featured images.

any website can be seen it needs to be transferred
from a local/home computer to a web server where
the website is ‘hosted’. A web host provides the
service that gets a website out onto the internet for
all to see. Web servers are like a desktop PC in the
fact that they have similar hardware, but they are
much more powerful and run different software.
A web host provider such as Fasthosts (www.
fasthosts.co.uk), 1&1 (www.1and1.co.uk), Heart
Internet (www.heartinternet.co.uk), Host Papa
(www.hostpapa.co.uk) and PlusNet (www.plus.
net) all provide a wealth of services including
web space, monthly bandwidth, domain names,
email accounts, databases, platforms and typically
a host of web building tools. All of these services
are included with a web hosting package, but
each web host will have different hosting plans.
The different plans provide everything from starter
plans through to powerful plans for business. What
type of plan is needed depends very much on
what type of website is being set up. If it’s a simple
blog site that gets updated once a week and has
an audience of around 500 visitors a month then a
cheap starter plan would be ideal. If it is a company
website with much more content and a lot more
visitors expected then a more professional plan will
be needed.
So what does all the jargon mean? The more
important considerations are web space and
bandwidth. Web space is storage space, the same
as a hard drive. How much is needed obviously
varies dependent on the content, but if it’s a blog
with standard text and images then it’s unlikely
that more than 1GB of web space will be needed.
If more than text and images are going to be
displayed, for example video, photos, music, then
1GB of web space can be filled very quickly. Ten
gigabytes or more is a better option for such a
site. It is a good idea to estimate how much web
space you will need before embarking on choosing
a hosting plan. Don’t worry too much though,
because web space can be upgraded easily and
typically within 24 hours.
The other major factor is bandwidth, which is
usually measured by the month. Bandwidth is the
traffic, or the amount of data that is transferred to
or from a website. A quick method for estimating
monthly bandwidth is the sizes of the pages on
a website multiplied by how many visitors are
expected. For example, if a website has a total
page size of 1MB and the expected visits are 500, a
bandwidth of around half a gigabyte is sufficient.
However, if there is a spike in visitors due to sudden
interest then this could easily be doubled. Again,
there is no need to worry as the bandwidth can be
increased when needed.
Other considerations are databases, if setting up
a WordPress blog then at least one database will
be needed. If building a static brochure site that
just consists of text and images then a database

Joomla is an alternative to the WordPress web publishing platform, check out all your
options before choosing the one you go with

The WordPress platform has become so popular that it has
spawned a range of related merchandise

At the time of going to press, the latest incarnation of WordPress has
reached over 38 million downloads

Blogs and social media websites are now
an integral part of the online experience
for many people. WordPress and Twitter
are synonymous with web publishing and
micro-blogging. WordPress has become
the most popular web publishing
platform because it is freely available,
websites using it can be either self-hosted
or hosted on wordpress.com, and it has
a whole selection of supporting tools
and themes.
WordPress is the power behind millions
of websites, it is easy to install, even for
newcomers, and easy to customise and
navigate around. There are thousands
of themes on the market, which can
instantly give a website a completely new
appearance with a single click. There is

Twitter is a good example of a micro-blogging platform that complements
more traditional blogging platforms such as WordPress

also a vast array of plug-ins that allow
users to add special widgets that perform
specific tasks, for example adding polls,
image sliders, tweets, featured content
and so on. The beauty of blogging
platforms such as WordPress is that they
provide a platform for users to get their
opinions, thoughts and personality online.
While WordPress is the most popular web
publishing platform it is by no means the
only one out there. Joomla and Drupal
are similar content management systems,
but at the other end of the scale there are
easy to set up, hosted platforms such as
Tumblr and Flavors.me.
More instant web publishing is
provided by the social media/microblogging platform Twitter. This allows
users to communicate with short,
concise, 140-character or less, messages
(tweets). Messages are sent to all those
who choose to follow you but more
importantly the addition of a hashtag
(#) makes a tweet subject specific. This
immediately expands the reader base
to include thousands more readers of a
tweet. As a promotional tool Twitter is key
on the web. Web sites typically include
social media links encouraging visitors to
follow. Conversely, it provides the perfect
platform to create interest amongst
followers and beyond. A well-constructed
tweet will engage readers and more
importantly drive traffic to a website.

Themes not only make a WordPress site look great, but they can be tailored to your particular
business or personality and can be changed in seconds

is unlikely to be required. If setting up a site with a
shop then a database is likely to be needed. As a
general rule it’s always worth getting a hosting plan
with at least one database included. Email accounts
are an obligatory addition to any hosting plan and
even the most basic package will include more than
are usually needed. As an example, the 1&1 Starter
plan provides 1,000 email accounts. The other major
web hosting consideration is the operating system

tools that a web designer/developer will need to
know to get a website up and running. The most
immediate is HTML and CSS, these are the most
important elements of any website, as without
them the web simply would not exist as we know
it. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides
the base from which every website is built. Anyone
looking to build a website will need to know at the
very least the basics of HTML. The latest incarnation

“Building a website is like building a house
– you need a host of tools”
(OS), typically Windows or Linux. This is not dictated
by the OS your computer is running; it relates to
OS that the web server is running. It only matters
if you’re going to build a basic HTML and CSS site.
However, if a certain technology is to be used, it
may only run on a certain operating system.

Tools of the trade
Building a website is much like building a house; a
host of tools are needed to make sure that the job
gets done. There are a few essential techniques and

of HTML is HTML5 and newcomers to web design
will need to make sure that, along with all the
standard HTML tags, they also add HTML5 tags to
the learning list.
Sitting alongside HTML in the web design
hierarchy is Cascading Style Sheets, which is
commonly known as CSS and it is just as important
that website builders know at least the basics.
CSS adds style to the front end of a website and
defines the layout, whatever it may be, style fonts,
borders, images, and create a background canvas

Keeping it safe
Security is an often forgotten issue when it comes to
a website, and there are a few simple rules that need
to be followed to ensure that a website’s security
is not breached. Passwords are the most popular
form of securing access to a website, whether it’s
via an online login page, such as WordPress, or an
FTP package used for transferring files from a local
computer to a server where a site is hosted. One
quick tip is not to use the password ‘password’!
As obvious as it may seem, the default password
is often left and not changed. Try and choose a
username that is not too obvious and ensure that a
password uses upper and lower case characters and
numbers. If it’s hard to remember try not to write
down and leave it next to your computer.
If using a web publishing platform, ie WordPress,
some simple commonsense precautions are to
update to the latest version. In addition, update any
plug-ins and themes and also remove any inactive
themes and plug-ins. Other security measures are
more generic but just as important. Make sure that
any OS updates are installed and make sure that any
anti-virus and firewall software is kept up-to-date.

for a webpage. In fact, any aesthetic seen on a web
page has almost certainly been in contact with CSS.
The latest incarnation of CSS is CSS3, which adds a
host of new effects and styles that are slowly being
adopted and supported by all the major browsers.
Outside of the key technologies there is a trio of
development platforms that are typically used in a
website build. JQuery is the programming language
that gives added dynamics to web pages. The
jQuery language is a JavaScript library and is added
to a web page to create effects that typically add
movement. What can jQuery do? Typical examples
include tabbed panels, image sliders, slide shows,
sliding panels, expanding and collapsing accordions
and tool tips to name a few.
Getting to grips with jQuery is not an essential
element of design, but it is something that should
be put on any web designer’s to-do list when
they’ve mastered HTML & CSS. Other backend
technologies that power many websites are PHP
and MySQL. PHP is a programming language that
plays a big part in the makeup of the WordPress
publishing platform. Typically, PHP is embedded
into an HTML page and produces dynamic results.
MySQL is a database application, which means it
stores information entered into a site. It is often
combined with PHP and a typical example of
the two in action are WordPress posts where the
content is stored in a MySQL database.
Getting all the essential technologies onto a page
is the work of a selection of tools. An HTML editor
is critical and one of the most popular software
packages on the market is Dreamweaver. Part of
the Adobe Creative Suite, it offers a user-friendly
interface and an impressive set of tools that assist
any web designer with what they need. The
alternatives are explained elsewhere. An HTML
editor needs to be accompanied by an imageediting package to make sure that a website is
beautiful while functional. The popular choice is
Photoshop, which provides powerful tools that are
perfectly capable of creating any web graphic in

The beauty of the platform lies in its ability to
build a complete site in minutes. The framework is
provided and then it is just a matter of selecting a
theme for the desired finish. The user adds content
while WordPress provides the structure.
Web sites are viewed in web browsers and the
four major web browsers – Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Google Chrome and Safari – all offer different
levels of support to HTML and CSS. And for this
very reason they are an essential part of the web
design process. All sites need to be tested in each
browser to make sure that they work as intended,
so it’s always a good idea to find out a little about
what browsers support when building a site. Finally,
while not really tools of the trade in the traditional
sense, services such as YouTube and Twitter are still
key players. Both offer the opportunity to embed
or integrate elements into a web page with code
supplied via the mother site.

Different ways to build a website
The tools needed to build a site are all integrated
into a website in different ways. A website is by its
definition a web presence, and how it gets built is
almost irrelevant – users want to see a functional
site in action, very few care how it was built, apart
from web designers of course!
The options for building a website range from
the simple to the specially made. At one end of the
scale there are instant, no-nonsense, no-knowledge
services such as Flavours.me. These are services
that appeal to those who want to get online quickly,
or those who want an elegant, easy-to-customise
web presence. Users build a page from predefined
layout elements and styles and draw content from
existing services such as WordPress, Twitter, Flickr.
Template builders sit very closely in the building
process and are often found with many web
hosting plans such as 1&1. These provide predefined
elements, pages, images and so on in a logical
step-by-step process and need no web design
knowledge. Stepping up the ante is WordPress,
which in principle is another quick and easy website
building tool. There are two versions available;
wordpress.com, where a site is hosted on the

Top tools of the trade
There are effectively three tools needed for the construction of a website. A knowledge of HTML and
CSS, an HTML editor and a graphics editor. Sounds simple and in essence it is, but finding the right
tool that suits requirements and personality is important. The first, most important tool is a HTML
editor, and there are hundreds of choices available, free and paid for (see What’s the best software
on page 19). CSS is another text-based language and a text editor would suffice, but again a good
knowledge of the language is needed. A good alternative is a CSS editor such as Rapid CSS (www.
blumentals.net/rapidcss) or TopStyle (www.svanas.dynip.com/topstyle/index.html). A graphics
editor is crucial for any web designer and the popular choice is Photoshop. This is a great package but
expensive. The popular alternative is GIMP (www.gimp.org).
Beyond software packages there are some great in-browser tools. Firefox includes some great
developer tools that help deconstruct a page. Add-ons such as Firebug (www.getfirebug.com)
extend the browser’s capabilities making the Mozilla browser the web designer’s choice.
There is an Aladdin’s cave of online tools that will help with every aspect of the web design process.
Aviary (www.advanced.aviary.com) is a suite of powerful creative applications, that includes an
image editor, screen capture and
vector editor. CSS Click Chart
(www.css3clickchart.com) is a
great tool that creates code for
the latest CSS3 specification.
Initializr (www.initializr.com)
is a tool that helps create a
basic HTML5 template which
web designers can build on.

(colorsontheweb.com/

WordPress servers, and a self-hosted version. The
.com option is created online and offers a simplified
version of the platform. The self-hosted version is
the full package where the user needs to provide
their own web space to install the web publishing
platform. Once installed users can change a
theme, add plug-ins, customise the code base and
completely restyle the look.
Finally, at the top end of the scale is the bespoke
or custom website that is built from scratch using
all the latest web technologies and tools. This
gives over total control of the build to the designer,
with the only restriction being the designer’s own
imagination and knowledge.

What to do next
Once a site has been built and hosted on the web,
what happens next? What more can you do with
your site? Looking past the practical considerations

– blogs, photographs, ecommerce and so on – a
site needs to be seen. It doesn’t matter how
aesthetically pleasing, innovative and intuitive a site
is, if no one gets to see it, it’s worthless.
Any new website exists in a vast labyrinth of
online experiences and promotion is the key
to getting a site seen. The methodology and
techniques to achieving a starring role on the web
are wide and varied. The first and maybe most
important is the domain name. This is the address
people will type into the browser (for example
www.iloveshopping.com).
This should reflect the name of the site. There
is little point calling a site ‘I Love Shopping’ and
using the domain name www.shoppinglove.com
– the two should match for brand completeness.
And, if possible, get the .com version.
Google is the top search engine across the globe
that is used by over 80 per cent of internet users,

which equates to billions of people, so your site
needs to be made Google-friendly. There are a host
of elements that add value to a page: meta tags,
sitemaps, alt tags and more. The best way to get
Google-friendly is to call on Google themselves. Try
out their Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide
at http://bit.ly/KGzh07.
You shouldn’t ignore social networks, either.
Outside influences such as Twitter and Facebook
are great communication channels with potentially
huge audiences. Every time something on a site is
updated, you should be sure to tell your followers
and friends. If nothing new is happening then make
it happen!
Finally, make sure your website content is
consistent, error free, current and regularly updated
with new and exciting content. Nobody wants to
visit a website that hardly ever has anything new to
give its readers.

The mobile web

Smartphones
and tablets are now
as much part of the web
browsing experience as the
desktop. With the adoption of mobile
devices comes a new set of resolutions and
rules for web designers. Smartphones typically
have a screen width of 320 pixels in portrait
mode and 480 pixels in landscape mode. Tablets
are a more diverse bunch, but as a typical
example, the iPad has a width of 768 pixels in
portrait and 1024 pixels in landscape. Desktops
vary from 1024 pixels up to around 1900 pixels.
The variation in sizes demonstrates the issue
of designing for mobile and desktop. One
option is to build a mobile-specific version of a
desktop website, but this not only adds to the

18 Web Design for Beginners

workflow of a designer but also adds to the
development cost for a company. The current
solution is ‘responsive design’, which looks to
cater for all screen resolutions and ultimately all
devices and desktops, in turn future-proofing
any website design. Responsive design uses
CSS3 media queries, which recognise the width
of a device and then switches the content to the
appropriate version of the website to ensure the
best on-screen display.

TheWarface (www.warface.co.uk) website is a great example of
responsive design in action. Great on mobile and great on desktop

What’s the best software?
Writing code, typically HTML and CSS,
is nothing more than a collection of
alphanumeric characters, so nothing
more complicated than a text editor is
enough for creating code. Notepad (PC)
and TextEdit (Mac) are free text editors
that are perfectly capable of producing
code, but they offer no assistance in the
way you write it. So, a plain text editor is
really for the more experienced coder.
However, while beginners and
newcomers may struggle with the
language to begin with, this approach
will reap rich rewards down the line.
Mastering HTML and CSS via handcoding will mean that clean, semantic
and lightweight code will be the
eventual outcome.
Beyond the plain text editor, the
next steps you’ll need to conquer are
the HTML editors. These are more
specific text editors which incorporate
related coding features. They provide an

WorldMags.net

environment that offers assistance and
help create a code base. These are much
less expensive than high-end packages
and provide enough tools to assist with
the page building process.
At the top end of the scale are
feature-heavy packages such as Adobe
Dreamweaver, which are comparatively
expensive. As you might expect, highend packages do not simply offer a plain
text interface. They offer a whole host
of tools, such as pre-built templates,
useful code widgets, colour-coded code,
multiple views and instant code creation.
Choosing an HTML editor is very
much a subjective choice and web
designers will all have their favourites
that they prefer to build with. The simple
solution is to try a few of the free HTML
editors that are available on the market
and familiarise yourself with how they
operate. It is almost guaranteed that one
will fit your method of working.

An introduction to

HTML
T

he majority of web pages are made up of
one or more files that are downloaded to
a computer, which in turn are interpreted
by a web browser and finally rendered out to
screen. At its simplest, a web page is a plain text
file that contains special instructions about what
kind of content is contained within. These
instructions are written in HTML – the language
used on the world wide web.
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language to give it
the full name, is the core building block of a web
page. HTML is a markup-based, human-readable
language that’s designed to be simple to write,
and easy to understand. A markup language is
one where bits of data are literally marked as
being of a particular type. So, for example, a piece

HyperText Markup Language, more commonly
know as HTML, is the basic building block of
the web. It provides the structure, content and
connection between pages, allowing web
designers to create interactive experiences.
Easy to learn, it offers limitless possibilities…

of data that you want to render as a paragraph
would be ‘marked up’ with a paragraph marker.

Marking up
Markers are referred to as tags, and they have
less-than and greater-than symbols around them.
This paragraph would be marked up with a <p>
tag at the start to denote a paragraph, and a
matching </p> tag at the end to signify the end
of the paragraph. HTML offers many tags for
marking up content, and browsers are
programmed to interpret these tags, formatting
the contents of each tag according to a set of
preset rules. This allows the <strong> tag to
render text in bold, and the <em> (for emphasis)
tag to render in italics. One of the major benefits

WorldMags.net

of this system of marking up content is that it’s
easy to read – you don’t need any special
software to either write or read HTML documents,
as they’re just plain text. This makes it easy to
create a functioning web page using nothing
more complex than a text editor.

What exactly is HyperText?
Why is the language called HyperText Markup?
Because the key thing that makes the World Wide
Web a web, rather than a series of disconnected
pockets of content, is the ability to link one
document to another – these links are HyperText
because clicking on them takes you somewhere
else in the vast web of pages! As well as a basic
HTML (text) document, web pages can call in

external files (or ‘assets’) that include style sheets,
images, audio files, video, flash and scripts. The
web browser looks at the HTML document when
it downloads it, and looks for any external files
that are called into the page. If it finds any files
called in, the browser will send a message back to
the web server asking for those files. The final
result you see in your web browser window may
be the result of more than 20 individual files,
brought together by the web browser and
rendered as a single web page!

Recognising an HTML document

HTML is the basic language of the web, and works no matter
which browser you use, or what server provides the page

All websites are built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

You’ll notice as you browse around the web that
different pages have different names, and more
importantly they have different extensions at the
end of the filename. Some end with .htm or .html,
which are obviously HTML documents, but others
might end with .cfm, .php, .asp or .aspx. What are
these file types?
As far as the web browser is concerned, they’re
just normal HTML documents like every other on
the web. What these different extensions signify
is that some sort of processing has happened on
the server before the page was sent to your

browser, allowing the website to generate some
unique-to-you content.
All the examples we’ve noted above have
similar characteristics. They’re scripts, or small
computer programs, that run on the server and
make some decisions about what content to
show. This might be as simple as including your
name at the top of the page when you’re logged
in, or as complex as a fully loaded e-commerce
web store, but all these ‘server-side languages’
output the same final result – plain HTML. It’s
important that the web works this way, as every
web browser only has to support one kind of
page structural language, which makes it easier
for both web designers and browser vendors, not
to mention for users of the web who know that
all they need to access any website is a web
browser and an internet connection.

Who invented HTML?
In the Eighties and Nineties the internet already
existed, but didn’t have any simple way of
navigating between computers and content.
Each server had different software, different
protocols and methods for sharing data. Tim

What is HTML5?
HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML specification, which is managed by the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This latest iteration of the standard introduces new features
and support for multimedia directly inside an HTML document. One of the key
considerations for the W3C is maintaining backwards compatibility, however, and HTML5
remains backwardly compatible with all web browsers and renderers.
The most exciting aspect of the HTML5 specification is the semantic approach to
marking up content. For the first time, web designers can mark up an article as such –
especially useful given the nature of blogs, news websites and the like.

“The most exciting aspect of
HTML5 is the semantic approach
to marking up content”

HTML5 makes adding content to your web pages a much simpler process

24 Web Design for Beginners

Over the past decade, video on the web has exploded. As bandwidth has increased,
and more people have access to high-speed internet connections, the likes of YouTube
and Vimeo have gripped the imagination of web users across the globe. Until HTML5, the
most reliable and common method for including video on a web page was to render it
using Adobe Flash. Both YouTube and Vimeo previously used this approach by default,
but both sites have snow switched over to the more accessible and standards-friendly
HTML5 version as the browser vendors have updated their software to support the
all-new <video> tag.

Berners-Lee was working in a computer services
section at CERN – the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland. Tim
realised that it would be useful to have a simple
method for sharing information remotely, and
rather than invent a completely new system from
scratch, he developed a markup language based
on the popular SGML format. He developed a
straightforward protocol – HTTP (which stands for
HyperText Transfer Protocol) – for retrieving other
documents’ text via hypertext links. The text
format for HTTP was named HTML, for HyperText
Markup Language. By keeping it simple, Tim
encouraged others to build upon his ideas and to
design further software for displaying HTML, and
for setting up their own HTML documents ready
for access. This was the birth of the web as we

Apple decided to promote the use of semantic,
standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, rather than
support Adobe’s rich media plug-in, Flash. Adobe
argued that Flash was a good solution for
presenting rich content on mobile devices, while
Apple insisted that open technologies with
proper semantic meaning and no need for a
plug-in was preferable. Time has favoured Apple’s
approach, in no short part due to the huge
success of its iPhone and iPad products!

What are these semantics?

know it today, and led to an explosion in use
of the internet. HTML itself has been further
developed over time, and we’re now up to its
latest version – version 5.

All new and improved: HTML5
You can’t fail to have noticed the talk of HTML5 in
recent years. Even non-web-savvy users have
come across the term, largely thanks to Steve
Jobs and the iPhone. HTML5 is the latest iteration
of the HTML language, and looks very much the
same as the previous versions. New tags that
provide greater semantic meaning to the content
being marked up have been introduced, along
with native support for rich media such as audio
and video. The ability to make a document
self-describing offers numerous benefits, but it’s
worth pointing out that when the term HTML5
is used – especially in the press – it often refers to
a trilogy of technologies rather than just the
HTML language itself. The press interpretation of
HTML5 includes both CSS3 and JavaScript in
addition to the HTML5 language, and is often
used to describe the experience of interactive,

content any way you like. This is both a benefit
and a potential issue as the flexibility to present
(and mark up) content in any way also means that
you can quickly end up with a confusing mess! A
movement to present information in a semantic
fashion existed at the birth of the language, and
has seen a resurgence in recent years.
The general idea is that content should be
marked up according to its type and importance.
<h1> heading tags, for example, should only be
used to mark up the most important piece of info
on a page, <h2> for the second most important
and so on. If you think about the analogy of a
book, the <h1> tag might be the book or chapter
name, <h2> would be a section header and so
on. By using this approach, the HTML describes
the importance of each piece of info which helps
search engines identify what your page is about,
and more importantly special software, such as
screen readers that translate web pages into
audio for people with sight problems, can make
more sense of the document.
In the past, content has been marked up using
heading and paragraph tags, but content has

HTML &
mobile
browsing
When you access the web from your mobile
phone or tablet, you’ll often notice special
pages that have been formatted especially for
these devices, rather than the full desktop
version of a website. You might have
wondered whether these pages use a special
language especially for mobile devices? The
good news is that, just like the rest of the
web, they use standard HTML. The only real
difference between a page optimised for a
mobile device and one orientated towards a
desktop computer is the CSS styles that have
been applied. The content, and often the
structure, of the page remains plain HTML
and there’s no need to learn special skills or
additional languages to be able to create sites
that on these devices. That’s not to say that
you shouldn’t consider how your users are
accessing the web page and what
information they might need!
Typically, a mobile-optimised website will
be presented in one of two ways: either it will
be the full website presented to render nicely
on the smaller screen size that you find on
phones and tablets, or it will be a special
version of the website that doesn’t contain
the same information as the full website. This
latter approach supposes that a mobile visitor
to your site is likely to be more goalorientated than a desktop visitor, and aims to
present the key information quickly, such as
‘how to find us’, or ‘our contact details’.

site

The new HTML5 specification has been drawn up by the W3C, an
organisation set up to act as the gatekeeper for web standards

been grouped using the same single nondescript
tag, <div>. This tag is, by itself, nothing more than
a method for delimiting different pieces of
information so that it might be used around a
navigation bar, or just as likely around an article
on a web page. As HTML5 has been introduced,
new semantically orientated tags have been
introduced that allow designers to mark up
navigation with a <nav> tag, headers with a
<header> area and articles with <article>. There
are more of these semantic tags available, but
some browsers are still implementing HTML5 so
we’re in a period of transition where you’ll still see
a huge number of plain old <div> tags used.

What about Flash?
Up until the launch of the iPhone, the de facto
method for presenting interactive rich content
(with animated elements, video and audio) was
Adobe Flash. This is a plug-in that sits inside an
HTML document, but runs as a separate program
within the web browser. When Apple released
the iPhone it decided not to support Flash, largely
because of the problems Flash had with crashing
browsers, and the lack of support for touch
screens. This decision helped kick-start a
movement away from the plug-in towards the
combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Whereas five or six years ago most interactive
image galleries were created using Flash, today
the majority are rendered using standard HTML
and either CSS, JavaScript or most commonly
both. Flash is still useful for certain types of
content – it’s a very popular method for showing
video on the web (although this will change as
HTML5 is fully implemented by browsers), and
games are currently easier to code in Flash.
Flash isn’t nearly as accessible as HTML, either
from a developer point of view or from a user
perspective, especially with regard to disability
access. Adobe has worked to improve this over
the years, but the technology isn’t ever going to
be as accessible as a plain-text-based system
such as HTML.

HTML: function, not form
In the early days of the internet, HTML included a
large variety of methods for changing the way

26 Web Design for Beginners

content displayed. For example, an early option
was the <font> tag which allowed you to specify
the typeface that you’d like the content and
information to be rendered in. This allowed
designers to very precisely choose how their
content was displayed, but when a website
consisted of 50 pages and the designer wanted to

What’s next for HTML?
HTML has come a long way since its invention in a
computer lab in Switzerland, and it’s continuing
to develop. The HTML5 specification is already
partially implemented in browsers, but other
elements of the language are still being
discussed, and there’s a good probability that

“HTML has come a long way since its
invention in a Swiss lab”
change the font, it was a mammoth task to work
through every page and replace every single
reference to the choice of font.
As a solution, CSS was introduced. CSS, as you’ll
see elsewhere in this book, is a system for
applying styles – defining the form and aesthetic
of a page. This means that now we can treat
HTML as a structural language only – we don’t
define the way a web page looks using HTML, just
how it’s structured and content arranged in a
semantic hierarchy. The net result is that by
separating form and function we can now
change a font that’s used throughout a big
website with just a single change to the CSS style
sheet, saving time and ensuring design
consistency throughout.

we’ll see further enhancements in the coming
years such as the ability to specify different
resolution images to be downloaded to desktop
computers from those sent to mobile devices.
There’s been an explosion in smartphone use
over the past few years which has led increasingly
to the web being accessed on the move. These
devices have a different screen orientation to the
traditional computer, often have less bandwidth
and computing power, but expect to have a
fantastic browsing experience. The HTML
language, through HTML5, is already adapting to
meet this challenge, but as the specification
matures you can expect to see further
enhancements with this usage scenario in mind.
It’s an exciting time to be a web designer!

HTML4 then you should feel at home, just be
aware of the new tags. If you've not written any
HTML before then good news, as it’s now easier
to understand! HTML5 has added in a lot of new

elements which help the browser interpret the
layout of the page easier. <header> and <footer>
are two examples, and describe common top and
bottom elements of a page respectively.
When starting out in web design it’s important to
remember to ‘open’ and then ‘close’ tags correctly.
Opening a tag looks like ‘<example>’ while closing

“There’s a relatively small amount of code
that you'll need to remember”

A simple two-column page

elementary webpage

The head tag
While usually invisible to the website
visitor, the head tag contains
important information for the
browser, such as CSS styles as well
as search engine information

Header tag
The header differs from the head,
as it’s contained within the body
of the HTML page, meaning it
gets displayed in the browser. The
header usually contains company
insignia, navigation and possibly an
introductory image

Footer
The footer tag denotes an element
that usually goes at the bottom
of the content, and contains
items such as author, contact info,
telephone numbers etc

NEW ELEMENTS IN HTML5
In this tutorial we use a few tags that were only introduced in
the HTML5 specification. Elements such as 'header' and 'footer'
in HTML4 would be defined solely by a class or ID applied to a
div. It’s important to remember that some older browsers may
not recognise these new elements correctly. A remedy to this is
to use JavaScript solutions such as Modernizr or HTML5Shiv.

with ‘</example>’. Note the ‘/’. Any thing within
those two elements will be considered its children;
they are contained within the element. This is
important to remember when you later use CSS and
then JavaScript. So open your text editor of choice
– be it NotePad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or
something more high-end – and let's get started!

Div tag
A div is used to group content
together, in this case we use it to
display our content and sidebar. Divs
can be nested within each other and
can have IDs and classes applied to
them so they can be identified

01 The HTML base

02 Create the head

First up, the doctype tells the browser what kind of content to expect. In
HTML5 it’s simple: <!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"></html>.

Next up is the <head> element, where we place all the files we wish to
include within our page, eg CSS style sheets, which we'll learn about later.

03 Add the body

04 Add the header

The <body> is where all the viewable page content goes. In it we’ll add the
header, the main content area, sidebar and a footer perhaps for a sitemap.

The <header> is typically used to hold the main site image, with a title and
possibly site navigation. You can have multiple <header> tags on a page.

05 Sidebar and content

06 Add the footer

The main content can be placed within a 'div', then a class applied to it: <div
class='content'> </div>. The sidebar can be placed after it, also with a class.

The <footer> element usually contains quick links to common areas of the
site such as 'Contact us', and sometimes has copyrights or addresses.

Code a link

Adding in links to other pages in your site and external sites is a key part of web design

W

hile links may seem like a simple element to add to a webpage, they are
the key building blocks of the entire internet. Imagine having to type a
different address into the browser for every single page you wanted to visit
on the web! Similar to pages within a book, separate webpages within a website help to
break up content by topic or purpose. Then, by adding in a navigation bar or something
similar to your site, it means that visitors will be able to quickly move to the content that
they are interested in.
Links are also one of the most important elements that Google and other search
engines use to find and index your site. The kind of content that you link out to, and the
kind of content contained within sites that link to your pages, are vital in informing the
search engine on how to categorise your site for its search results.
This tutorial will take you through adding in links leading to other pages in your
website, and how to link out to other people’s sites. Once you have added some links,
your site can start to function how it’s intended to, with visitors being able to view all the
content contained with ease.

“Links are the key building blocks
of the entire internet”
Adding in links to pages
Adding links to other pages
is straightforward

Link text

Default styling

The link text is what your user will see,
so make sure it’s descriptive. Try to
avoid using 'click here'; instead, word
the surrounding text, eg view my <a
href”gallery.html”>gallery</a>

Without adding in any styling of
your own, links will be underlined
and blue, and once visited will turn
purple. Your cursor will also change
appearance in most browsers

<a> tag
The <a> tag is what denotes a link,
and is used on practically every
webpage on the internet to link to
other documents and sites

href
The 'href' part is where you enter in
the destination for the link. Usually
this will be somewhere else within
your site, but it can also be to
another page on the internet

RELATIVE PATHS
Relative paths or links, can only be used when linking to pages or files within
a site directory. A simple example is <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>.
This assumes that the page is in the same directory as the file that contains the
link. To link to a file in a different directory, the name of the location (typically
a folder) will need to be included, for example: <a href="portfolio/portfolio.
html">Portfolio</a>

01 The basic ‘a’ tag

02 Href

A link is denoted using the 'a' tag, short for anchor. We have already briefly
touched on this when we looked at common HTML tags. To start off your
link, enter in: <a> </a>. However, unlike some other HTML tags, an anchor
needs a little more information in order for it to work properly.

The link needs a destination so that when it’s clicked, the browser
knows where to go. This is added in using 'href'. For example,
<a href=”http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/” ></a> would send the
browser to that external website.

03 Internal links

04 Add link text

To link to another page in your own site, you simply add the name of the
page; eg <a href=”contact.html” ></a>. This assumes that the contact.html
page is within the same folder as the page we are working on. See the
‘Relative paths’ boxout for more information.

To make the link visible to the user, add in some text between your opening
and closing <a> tags. For example: <a href=”gallery.html”> See My Gallery</
a>. Open the page in your browser, and assuming the gallery.html page
exits in the same directory, clicking the text will take you there.

Create lists in your website
Learn how to quickly create various lists within your webpages using HTML

L

ists are an effective way of presenting important information in a way
that’s quick and easy for your audience to read and digest. They are also
a good method for giving a brief overview or introduction of the content to
follow, helping your users find what it is they are looking for.
Coding up a list in HTML is quick and very straightforward, and once you’ve got
the hang of the basics you can start to apply your own styles using CSS to make
them really stand out from the crowd, which we’ll come to later.
There are two main types of lists in HTML: ordered and unordered. An ordered list
starts at one and then increases. This is useful when you need to prioritise certain
entries and give preference those that appear higher up. Alternatively, ordered lists
are essential if you want to display a step-by-step guide that's easy to follow.
An unordered list is simply bullet-pointed; this style is useful when you just need
to display a list where the order is irrelevant. By default, lists will be indented from
the surrounding content and a circular bullet point will be used.
This tutorial will show you how to add lists to your pages, both ordered and
unordered, and also how to create lists within lists. The only thing you need to bare
in mind is not to go overkill with lists, leaving your content boring and 'listless'!

“Coding up a list in HTML is quick
and very straightforward”
Links within lists

Types of lists in HTML

Using the list tags to create ordered and unordered lists

Links can be put into lists simply by
wrapping an <a> tag around the
text. This is great for making menus
and navigation items

Unordered list
An unordered list is simply a series
of items grouped together. By
default they will be indented and
each item will have a bullet point
next to it

Nested lists
Lists can be embedded within other
lists simply by opening and closing
a <ul> or <ol> within another list.
These are then indented further, and
show a white bullet point

DEFINITION LISTS
Ordered list
An ordered list automatically
applies numbers of ascending
value to each item within it. This is
useful when you need to prioritise
content, for example

32 Web Design for Beginners

There is one other type of list in HTML – the definition list. It’s
quite rarely used but allows an indented description to be
added to each list item. An example definition list would be:
<dl>
<dt>Snowboard</dt>
<dd>- Great for freestyle tricks</dd>
<dt>Cross Country Skis</dt>
<dd>- Ideal for exploring on</dd>
</dl>

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net

01 Unordered list

02 Add list items

An unordered list by default is shown slightly indented with a bullet point
denoting each item. To add in an unordered list you use the <ul> tag.
Remember to close it with a </ul>.

Within your list, items are added using the list item tag like so: <li> </li>.
Text can go between the open and close li tags; for example: <li> Tea </li>.
Remember that the li tags must go within your <ul> tag.

03 Nested lists

04 Ordered lists

Lists can be embedded within other lists just by opening and closing a new
<ul> within another <ul>, and then list items can be added to that too. They
will then be indented again within that <ul>.

If you wish to number your list items then you can use the <ol> tag in place
of the <ul>. This will then replace the bullet points with ascending numeric
values for the list items.

Learn to use div tags
Learn about the all-important div tag in HTML and how
it’s used to group content

A

n HTML page is made up of a series of tags that tell the
web browser what to display and where. The main building
block of a page is a div tag, short for division. If you look at
a newspaper page, you will see that text is grouped together in
columns. Images with captions are also together with a margin
around them. A div in HTML is similar to this, and it’s usual to group
together content in a similar way. While HTML5 has added a few new
tags with more semantic names such as ‘header’ and ‘footer’, the main
body of most pages is still constructed using divs.
There is no limit on how many divs you have within a page
and most webpages you visit online will contain many, all
nested within each other. Divs can contain text,
images, video and audio, as well as other
HTML elements such as articles
and sections.
This tutorial will show you how to
make your first divs and then how to apply an
ID or class to them so when you’re ready you can apply
CSS styles, or use JavaScript on them. We’ll be using plenty of
them throughout the book!

Indenting divs

Properties of the div
Divs, classes and IDs

Once your pages get more complicated, they can feature
many divs all nested within each other. This can make it
hard to track where one opens and another closes. It’s
standard practice to indent the content of a div using the
tab button

Div classes
Classes are widely used in web
development to allow CSS styles to
be associated with elements within
your HTML page

IDs
IDs are used in a similar way to
classes, but there should only be
one element on a page with a
particular ID. IDs allow you to target
specific elements using JavaScript
for manipulation

NESTING DIVS
Many webpages are made up of a few main elements such as a
header and footer, and then a main content div. Within a div it’s
possible to have other divs. For example:
<div id=”content”>
<div class=”leftColumn”
</div>

Code highlighting
Most HTML editors offer code
colour highlighting of some sort.
This can help you when checking
which divs have classes applied etc

34 Web Design for Beginners

<div class=”rightColumn”
</div>
</div>
Doing this allows you to have a universal style to the ‘content’
div, and then apply different styles to the divs contained within.

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net

01 The basic div

02 Closing the div

A div is started by using this simple piece of code: <div>. Following on
from that, you can then insert all the content you want to contain within
the div.

Once you have inserted all the content, you need to make sure you close
off the div by using </div>. Note the forward slash denoting the ending
of the current div.

03 Adding an ID

04 Adding a class

A div can have a unique identifier so it can be recognised in a style sheet
or by any JavaScript you may add. To apply an ID to a div, use:
<div id=”myDivId”> </div>

Classes are similar to IDs, but many items on a page can have the same class.
To apply a class to a div, use: <div class=”myDivClass”> </div>
Using classes makes styling multiple elements much easier.

Create a three-column layout
Put what you’ve learnt so far into practice and make the popular
three-column webpage structure using HTML5

H

TML and CSS essentially allow for a
huge range of freedom when designing
your pages, but there are a few layout
principles that have developed over the years
which it’s a good idea to follow.
If you have a quick look at some of your favourite
sites on the internet it’s quite likely that they will use
a column layout, akin to a newspaper. A common
layout for a site is to have the site or company logo
at the top of the page, then have a column down
the left for navigation or links, a main content
section in the centre, and then a sidebar on the

36 Web Design for Beginners

right with supplementary information or Facebook
and Twitter feeds. This is then commonly rounded
off with a site-wide footer containing copyright
information, the name of the site designer, site links
and sometimes a contact address. This tutorial will

show you how to code up the HTML scaffolding
for a three-column layout using modern HTML5
elements. Once you have mastered this, it can then
be adapted into a two- or more-than-three-column
layout if you so wish.

”This tutorial will show you how to code up
the HTML scaffolding for a three-column
layout using modern HTML5 elements”

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net

01 Set up your HTML page
To start off, open up your favourite editor and
create the initial HTML elements as usual.
The first thing we need to add is the HTML5
doctype declaration:
001 <!DOCTYPE html>
This tells our browser that we are using the HTML
specification within the page, and it should be
placed right at the top of your HTML file.

02 Open HTML tag
Next up we need to start off our HTML by
entering the HTML tag – <html> – and then
making sure we close this with </html>.
This tag tells the browser that contained within
this section is HTML code. All the page content
that we will be creating will need to go within
these tags.

03 Insert the head
The head tag is an important one in HTML, and
shouldn’t be confused with the ’header’ tag.
Content within the head is not displayed to the
user, but is used to include your CSS style sheets,
JavaScript and metadata. Within your <html>
tags, place <head>, then </head> to close it off.

05 Define character set
04 Add a title
The title tag is used to display text in the
browser’s title bar at the top (if it has one), and
also used as a guide for search engines to identify
what content is contained within the page. Add
a <title> tag within your head. Next, add a page
title to describe the content, and close the title
tag with </title>.

There are many different ways of displaying
characters in computing, and a few different
standards depending on language; eg Greek or
Arabic text looks very different from Chinese.
Luckily for us, almost all the web uses the UTF-8
standard, which we define within our head with:
001 <meta charset=”utf-8” />
UTF-8 does a good job of displaying most
characters correctly.

06 The body tag
All the content you wish to be displayed to the
user is put within a ’body’ tag. This goes after
your ’head’ tag has been closed, but within your
<html> tag. Start it off with <body>, then close it
off in the normal way: </body>. From now on we
will place all code within the body tag.

09 The header
07 Adding comments

08 The container

Sometimes you may wish to add a note to a
location within your page, perhaps as a reminder
or to make it easier to see where certain elements
start or finish. Comments are started using ’<!--’,
followed by the comment text, and then ended
with ’-->’. For example: <!-- Start header -->

It’s quite common to wrap all the main content
within the body in a ’container’ div. This can make
styling and centring easier when you start to
write up your CSS. Add a container div within the
body with <div> and </div>, then give it an ID so
we can style it later: <div id=”container”>

WorldMags.net

The top element to our page is usually referred
to as a ’header’ and contains the site title, logo,
navigation, and sometimes adverts. To create
a header we use the header tag, which is new
in HTML5. To open it enter <header> and then
to close, </header>. A page can have multiple
headers, although they cannot be contained
within each other.
Web Design for Beginners 37

Build a WorldMags.net
site

10 Nav tag

11 Navigation items

12 First column

Nearly all pages contain a navigation or menu bar
of some sort to allow visitors to get around the
site. HTML5 now has a tag specifically for this. The
’nav’ tag is where to place links to other items.
Let’s add one to our page – <nav> – and then
close off again with </nav>.

To add links to the navigation we use the <a>
or anchor tag. Eg <a href=”products.html”>
Products </a>. If you don’t yet know your exact
site layout, it’s common to use a ’#’ in place of the
link. A hash symbol can also be used to target a
specific div within a page.

Now we can add our first left column. This goes
after the header tag, but still within our container
div. Add this in with <div> and then don’t forget
to close: </div>. Again, you can give it an ID or
class, such as <div id=”col1”></div>. This column
might contain a menu or adverts, for example.

13 Second column
The second column is usually the widest in the
centre, and normally houses the main page
content. Add it to the page the same way as
before, but give it a different ID this time.
001 <div id=”col2”> </div>
Don’t be concerned if you can’t see any content
within your browser – as without styling, divs
are essentially invisible and only the content
contained is displayed.

16 Metadata (optional)
If you know what content is going into the
pages and wish to improve search engine
optimisation, you can add meta information to
the head. Meta information helps Google and
other search engines to index and organise sites
by content. The meta description tag is used to
give a short account of the page content: <meta
name=“description” content=“Fishing in Dorset”>

38 Web Design for Beginners

14 Third column

15 The footer element

The third and final column is then added in
exactly the same way, with a unique ID: <div
id=”sidebar”></div>. If you wanted to place the
name within each div to see the results in the
browser and help you visualise the page layout,
then you can: <div id=”sidebar”>Sidebar</div>

The footer is used to mark the bottom of the
page, and often contains a list of common links,
along with copyright and/or contact information.
To add a footer we simply use the HTML5 footer
tag – <footer> – and as always, close it off using
</footer>. Place this after your sidebar column in
the code.

17 Stopping Google
indexing (optional)

18 The end result

To stop Google and other search engines
indexing your page, you can add the following
code to your head: <meta name=”robots”
content=”noindex”>. This means the page will not
be shown in Google’s search results. This can be
useful on client login pages, or out-of-date pages
that you wish to archive.

WorldMags.net

Save the file now, making sure to have the .html
extension at the end. Open the file within a
browser to see the result. As there is no styling
applied yet, it won’t look particularly attractive
by any means, but you’ve created a basic web
page layout that’s now ready for CSS and content
to be added.

<meta name=”robots” content=”noindex”>
There are a few common meta elements which, while
not displayed by the browser, help with search engine
optimisation as well as how the browser renders your content

The header

Footer

Columns

In this instance the header code
contains the navigation elements
of the page, although it’s also often
used for site title and logos. Here we
are using the HTML5 nav element

The footer element often remains consistent
throughout a site and is usually not as tall as
the header, although recently there have been
some great designs featuring very prominent
footer elements

The main columns are <div> elements
that you can apply CSS to later, such as
width, height, padding etc. It’s usual to
have the centre column the widest, but
this isn’t mandatory

Internet Explorer compatibility Ensure your HTML5 page works in IE
While most users of Chrome, Firefox and Safari run HTML5, there is still a large chunk
of the internet population running older versions of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer
which don’t support the new standard. With all the new HTML5 elements, it’s
required to add in a few workarounds to get everything to work satisfactorily. One
of the most popular methods is to use the HTML5Shiv . This small piece of JavaScript
allows us to include the new tags such as <header>, <footer> and <nav> without
worry. Adding the script is simple, and as it’s hosted on GoogleCode you don’t even
need to download any files. Simply add this to your page’s head:

<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src=”//html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js”></script>
<![endif]-->
The <!--[if lt IE9}> part is a CSS conditional statement which says ’if the browser trying
to read this page is IE and less than version 9 (which supports HTML5), then include
this JavaScript file. Hopefully in the not too distant future when more people are
running the latest version of Internet Explorer, hacks such as this can be avoided, but
for now it’s just something that we have to live with when designing pages.

An introduction to
If HTML provides the structure for a website, CSS provides the
form. This is the language that will make your site stand out

C

ascading Style Sheets, commonly
abbreviated to CSS, is a language used for
describing how HTML should be
presented. CSS documents provide all the
format, colour, positioning and other
characteristics of a design that you will see on
virtually any webpage.
Originally introduced alongside HTML4, the
language was designed to separate the structure
of a document from the presentation, improving
the control of a design for web designers. CSS
also helped to improve accessibility of web pages,
reduce HTML code complexity and crucially the
amount of repetition of markup that had to be
created to describe how a page should look.
As well as these benefits, the separation of
form and function allows different designs to be
displayed to users according to their device,
simply by providing a different style sheet. This
means that, for example, a mobile phone can
load the same webpage as a desktop browser,
but present the content within the page in a
different manner. Similarly, CSS can be used to
present page content one way on screen and a
second when printed, or to provide direction to
screen reader software over areas for emphasis.
Additionally, CSS is user-configurable, so while
the designer might specify that text should be
shown in 18pt red Arial, the visitor to their site can
load their own style sheet to show the text in
12pt blue Times instead, should they wish to. As
you can see, CSS offers a great deal of flexibility

by design. To fully understand what it’s capable
of, we need to look a bit more at what CSS is, why
and how it came about, and examine how the
implementation of the language works across
different web browsers.

The cascading bit
CSS is designed to use a priority scheme that
determines how styles should be applied to
HTML elements. The cascading bit of the
language name refers to how this scheme works.
Broadly, styles are applied in chronological order,
but also according to specificity. If a style
property is declared more than once for a
particular element, the last chronological
declaration will be used, unless the earlier
declaration was more specific about the elements
it should apply to than the latter. This sounds
really confusing, but in practice it allows you to
apply a set of broad styles that provide basic
properties for the font that text should be
rendered in, for example, and use more specific
selectors to subsequently set the size, colour or
font weight. To help make sense of it all, let’s take
a look at what CSS looks like in code.

CSS syntax
Just like HTML, CSS is designed to be humanreadable in its raw form. English keywords are
used with a simple syntax to describe a list of
rules, style properties and style values. Each rule
in a style sheet is defined by means of a selector,

WorldMags.net

CSS
which identifies the HTML elements the rule
should apply to. Within the rule, a series of
properties and values are defined so that the
visual characteristics for an element are built up
property by property. Let’s take a quick look at
an example:
001 h1 {
002
font-family:
sans-serif;
003
font-weight:
004
font-size: 18pt;
005
color:
006
margin: 10px;
007 }

arial, helvetica,
bold;
red;

In the code above we’ve defined the rule using
the h1 { } selector. This specifies that the style
properties within should apply to all <h1> tags
found on the page. Within the curly brackets we
define a series of properties, such as font-family,
font-size etc, and the values we’d like to set for
each. As a result, every heading 1 on our page

Web Design for Beginners 41

Build a WorldMags.net
site

Recent versions of web browsers have vastly improved their
implementation of CSS standards

would be rendered in Arial (or Helvetica if Arial
wasn’t available), bold 18pt red text. The entire
<h1> would have a ten-pixel margin around it.

More complicated selectors
In the previous example we used a simple
selector to establish which elements the rule
should apply to. Selectors can be nested so that
only specific elements have the rule applied. An

example might look like the code that follows:
001 #content article h1 {
002
color:
blue;
003 }
Here, the rule would only apply to HTML <h1>
elements that are nested inside an <article>
element, itself within any other element that has
an ID attribute of “content”. Our page would now
show all <h1> tags as red, bold, 18pt Arial, with
the exception of those headings inside an
<article>, itself inside an element with an ID of
#content where the colour would be blue instead.
This works because the CSS sheet cascades the
styles and also has the priority scheme we
discussed earlier. As our second rule is more
specific in its selector, it takes priority over the
more generic rule we created first. We could have
also positioned our second rule chronologically
after our first to ensure it would take priority, but
sometimes the specificity rules that are a part of
CSS would prioritise over chronology. By
combining specific selectors with different rules,
and using specificity and priority it’s possible to
style a document with a few SS rules.

Different ways to load a style
There are three different ways a style can be
applied to an HTML element. The first is through
an external file that is loaded into the HTML
document in the <head> section. The second is
to include a <style> declaration in the <head>
section of the document, writing your rules and
properties directly inside the <style> area, and
the third is directly onto an element using the
style attribute. The latter is referred to as an
‘inline’ style.
When calculating the style properties of an
element, CSS is loaded first from any external files
and applied, then from the <head> section of the
page, and finally from any inline styles. Where the
same property is set by more than one of these
three methods, they apply in the order as
described above.

Positioning elements
One of the most common areas of CSS that new
designers struggle to grasp is how elements can
be positioned on the page. CSS offers a number
of different positioning systems, and these can
be mixed and matched within a single page

Browser support
One of the biggest headaches over the past decade, at least for web
designers, has been the differences in the way browsers render CSS.
The original idea was that CSS would be rendered in a standard way,
regardless of what software a user had. Browsers that didn’t support
CSS would simply ignore it, but those that understood style sheets
would display content in a predictable, consistent manner. The issues
started almost as soon as CSS was introduced, however, with different
browser vendors implementing their own understanding of the
standards, leading to wildly different representations of a design
according to which browser a visitor to a website used.
The most well-known example of this was the box-model problem
where two browser vendors disagreed over whether padding should
be applied to an element in addition to the specified width, or as part
of the specified width. One method meant that an element set to be
200 pixels wide with 50 pixels of padding either side would render as
300px in total – 200 pixels of space for content, and 50 pixels padding
each side, while the other left the element width at 200 pixels overall,
leaving just 100 pixels for content. This particular disagreement lead to
Internet Explorer having special style sheets developed to work
around the ‘wrong’ implementation for more than ten years!
Microsoft has now officially retired IE6, although IE7 and 8 both
continue to support the old system, but as CSS3 properties have been
introduced the W3C designers are forced to specify the same
properties multiple times, targeting vendor-specific features.

design. The first, and default, positioning scheme
is ‘relative’ positioning. This operates on the
basis that an HTML document is chronological.
Much like a word processor, content that appears
beneath other content has its position on the
page dictated by the content above which
pushes it down into position.
In addition to relative positioning, CSS also
offers absolute positioning, where an element is
positioned according to a set of co-ordinates
relative to the container element. This allows
elements to be very precisely positioned on the
page, relative to the whole page.
Similar to absolute positioning is fixed
positioning. This works, as with absolute, using a
series of co-ordinates but rather than being
positioned relative to the page, ‘position: fixed’

getting to know how positioning, and especially
float, works.

History and potential hiccups
By now you’re starting to see the value and
potential of CSS, but it’s not all as perfect as it
might at first seem. There are a number of
problems that web designers have to overcome
when using CSS to style their web pages, and to
fully understand those issues it’s worth taking a
quick trip down memory lane.
When HTML3.2 was released, a series of new
tags were added that allowed web designers to
specify different visual characteristics for their
content. These included the likes of <font>, <b>
(for bold text), <color>, <center> and many
more. These tags provided the control over

“CSS offers absolute positioning of an
element according to set co-ordinates”
elements are always relative to the viewport (the
visible portion of the browser screen). As you
scroll, position fixed elements remain in the same
place in the browser window.
The final, and often the most confusing, system
is the floating element. This system allows
elements to push to one side or the other of the
containing element, with content and other
elements automatically flowing around it. This
takes some understanding and experimentation,
but is fundamental to achieving some common
layouts so it’s worth spending a little extra time

presentation that web designers were craving,
but a problem quickly emerged: by mixing style
with content the pages designers worked on
quickly became unmanageable, especially when
a web site had lots of pages. Something as simple
as changing the font a website used might have
taken days to change, working through each
HTML page in the website and changing
references from one font to another.
As a consequence, the W3C quickly realised
that content should be separate from
presentation, and developed CSS. CSS1 debuted

The
advantages
of CSS
CSS offers many benefits over the previous
idea of incorporating visual characteristics
into HTML. The most obvious one is that by
separating content from presentation, the
aesthetic of a webpage or entire website
can be tailored to individual user profiles or
devices with ease. A single HTML page can
be rendered in many different ways, as
amply demonstrated by the CSS Zen
Garden experiment (www.csszengarden.
com), and this characteristic can be used to
ensure that mobile devices see a layout
appropriate to their form while a desktop
computer sees a different rendering more
aligned to the larger screen estate. CSS
supports many different usage scenarios
including print and audio.
As well as the ability to tailor the
presentation according to device, user
characteristic or location, CSS also helps to
ensure consistency across an entire website.
Where multiple pages reference the same
CSS sheet, a change in the CSS is instantly
reflected across all those pages, saving the
designer time and reducing the risk of
inconsistencies. Along the same vein, CSS
allows multiple elements to be selected
and styled with a single selector. This
reduces the amount of code required to
achieve a design.
CSS makes the web more accessible; a
user can choose to load their own style
sheet onto any document. Useful for
visually-impaired users (who might need to
see content in a larger font size) this
characteristic also allows designers to
separate styles into multiple style sheets
with each applying an additional layer of
styling for easy organisation and adaptation
of a design.

CSS3 opens the web up to more users by allowing
individual stylesheets on pages
CSS3 brings animations to the mix by allowing designers to set up automatic changes in property values, altering over time

site
alongside HTML4 in 1996, but it wasn’t until some
years later that web browser vendors had
managed to fully implement the language. In the
meantime, a newer version of CSS had been
created in 1998, and Netscape and Internet
Explorer version 6 had both partially
implemented CSS2.
As well as the slow implementation, from the
start there were issues with the way the CSS
specification had been written, leaving room for
individual interpretation over what each part of
the specification meant. This resulted in Internet
Explorer rendering styles in one way, while the
other popular browser of the day, Netscape,
rendered differently. As well as differences in

“It’s only in the
last few years that
technology has
been implemented
properly”
opinion, both these popular browsers had their
own bugs and quirks that resulted in strange
behaviours when interpreting and rendering CSS.
To further compound the issue, as the web was
taking off and becoming mainstream, once the
damage had been done there was no easy way to
backtrack. The net consequence of these
unfortunate events was that web designers had
to start using workarounds to code different style
rules for different browsers, taking into account
the bugs, quirks and differences in rendering.

The arrival of HTML5
As the web has matured, so have the
technologies used to create it and CSS is no
different. HTML is now just about at version 5, and
CSS3 first came into existence at the beginning of
the century. It’s only in the last couple of years

CSS allows websites to be tailored according the device upon which the website is accessed

that either technology has started to be properly
implemented by browser vendors however, and
the combination of HTML version 5, CSS version 3
and JavaScript is often referred to collectively as
HTML5 (erroneously it must be said!).
As mobile devices have become increasingly
popular, driving the desire for access to the web
on the move, and across different screen sizes, so
the browser vendors have been coaxed into
accelerating their implementations. This has
provided quite a relief to web designers who only
a year ago were still implementing workarounds
for Internet Explorer version 6 – a decade-old
piece of software!

Differences of opinion

Although the technology has been around for years,
it’s only now we’re implementing it effectively

44 Web Design for Beginners

Despite the recent strides towards adoption of
CSS3, and the retirement of Internet Explorer 6 by
Microsoft, there continues to be quite a lot of
differences between the way different browsers
render CSS. The most common issue today is
where browsers implement CSS properties that
haven’t yet been fully ratified by the W3C. To
ensure compliance, vendors prefix these
properties with a name that represents the
browser’s maker. So, for example, to create a CSS
drop shadow we currently have to have a rule

that specifies properties for box-shadow,
-webkit-box-shadow, -moz-drop-shadow,
ms-drop-shadow and o-drop-shadow. The first
property is the actual CSS3 specification property,
while the others are the early implementations by
Safari and Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and
Opera respectively.
Vendor prefixes are the subject of much debate
currently as they’ve become more prevalent in
recent years as vendors rush to outdo each other
in their CSS implementations. For web designers
the new opportunities CSS3 presents are slightly
offset by the continuing need to provide
browser-specific properties for most of the
modern properties.

What does the future hold?
As you’ve read, CSS3 is still being implemented
and defined by both the W3C and browser
vendors. And as for the future? Don’t expect to
see it any time soon, but CSS4 has been in
development since 2009. It’s still in early draft
of course, but promises all manner of exciting
new styling options and properties. If we’re all
still designing websites in another ten years, no
doubt we’ll be discussing matching selectors and
reference combinators!

the position of the image in the element and
how the image repeats are configurable.

font-family The font-family property is the
method through which all the different fonts

web designers were forced to stick to a small set
of ‘web safe’ fonts, but in recent years great
advances have been made in providing webenabled fonts on demand through a style sheet.

border The border property allows the

define drop shadows on elements using the
box-shadow property. An offset can be assigned
independently on the X and Y axis, along with a
colour and amount of blur to apply.

margin The margin property defines the
amount of space the selected element should
be away from other elements in the document.
It works by pushing the other elements away
from it, providing ‘white space’ around the
element, and can be defined against each of the
top, bottom, left and right sides.

padding Similar to margin, padding also
provides white space to an element, but instead
of pushing other elements away, the white space
exists within the selected element. If an element
has a border, increasing the amount of padding
will push that border away from the content
within the element.

background The background property allows

colour The colour property sets the
foreground colour of any element which has a
foreground. Most commonly this is text,
although certain other elements also support
colour. If colour doesn’t work, most probably
you actually should be using backgroundcolour or just background for short.

corner-radius Also new with CSS3 is the

WorldMags.net

corner-radius property, which sets the
roundness of a corner on any block level
element. Radii can be defined independently
for each corner, along with the way the curve
should be applied.

position The position property is used to
define which positioning system should be
used on an element in the page. Confusingly,
however, should you want to use the float
system you need to use the float property to
define which direction the element should
float to.

Centre your page
Using CSS to wrap your page’s content in div tags gives you great control over the way it’s displayed

W

hen you’re designing a webpage, you
have to remember that a browser
window can be almost any shape
and size. Desktop computers have a wide range
of screen sizes, and mobile phone and tablets are
used to browse the web too. Your nicely designed
page could be ruined if you simply allow it to flow
into the browser window, regardless of the latter’s
size or shape. By creating a wrapper you can specify
the width of the webpage content and its position
in the browser window. It is an essential part of the
design process.

A ’wrapper’ is a commonly used name for a
piece of CSS code that is used with a div tag to
size and position the content of a webpage. A
div tag is placed at the start of the page content
just after the opening body tag and again just
before the closing body tag, thereby enclosing or
wrapping the content.

Set the margins

You can choose whatever colour
you want for the background. If you
choose a dark colour, though, you’ll
need to change the text to white –
and that’s for another tutorial!

Without margins, the page content is
displayed on the left. You can manually
set them by entering the number of pixels,
but a good option is to set them to auto to
centre the page

Set the width
How wide do you want the page
content to be? You can either set a
width in pixels, as shown here, or use
a percentage. 100% would be the

Borders or borderless?
This page has borders, but they
are optional and leaving out these
parameters will remove them. It’s your
choice. Padding, just above, is used for
extra spacing, but it isn’t needed

BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
There are several web browsers, but unfortunately
they all display webpages in slightly different ways.
Compatibility between browsers is helped by adding this
as the first line of the HTML file: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.
w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">. Find a

46 Web Design for Beginners

In CSS we can define how everything between
the div tags – the page’s content – is displayed. It
can be centred on the page, positioned a certain
number of pixels from the left, a border can be
added, its width can be fixed or variable and so on.
It is an essential component of any webpage and it’s
quite straightforward.

WorldMags.net

02 Add div tags

01 The CSS link
CSS definitions can be stored in a webpage or a separate file. If it is in a
separate file then any webpage can access it and it saves having to add it to
each new page. Add a link in the HTML header to a file called style.css.

We want to specify the size and position of the webpage content, so we
must place div tags at the start and end of the page, thereby enclosing all
the content. The CSS definition will be called ’wrapper’ and we refer to it
with id="wrapper".

03 Create the CSS

04 Flexible page width

We don’t yet have any CSS, so create a new file called style.css and add a div
ID called #wrapper. Set the width to 750 pixels. This value determines the
width of the webpage content because everything is contained within the
two div tags.

Set the page width using absolute dimensions and it may not fit on small
screens like mobile phones or tablets, or it may look tiny on computers with
large monitors. An alternative is to set it to a percentage of the browser
width instead.

05 Set the margins

06 Add the borders

We have specified the width for the page content, but not its position. With
margin-left you can specify the number of pixels from the left the content
is to be displayed. An alternative is to set both margins to auto to centre it in
the browser.

Your page design may look good if there is a border, and this specifies one
that is two pixels wide. The border colour is set to light grey (#CCCCCC) and
the border style is set to solid. Alternatives include dotted, dashed, double
and ridge.

Create CSS rules for displaying
the text on the page

very webpage contains text and it is
frequently the main content. You should
therefore ensure that it looks good by
choosing the fonts and styles to fit your design
and the image you want to portray. There might
only be a small amount of text if the main content
focuses on images, but even so, there will be titles,
links and captions. There's no getting away from
text on webpages.
You can add CSS code to a webpage to define
how the text is displayed, but placing it in a
separate .css file and linking to it in the page's

Style the text

As you make style changes, you can
see the effects on the page

head section means that the same text styles are
applied everywhere in your site. HTML font tags
have been replaced by CSS font-family definitions,
old-fashioned <i> and <b> tags are no longer
needed, and font-style and font-weight enable you
to set the styles to normal, italic, bold and so on. It
might seem like extra work for one webpage, but

when you are creating a site with 100 pages it is a
considerable time-saver.
Writing the CSS rules for the text is simple and
you can create a class that defines a text style and
then use it over and over again in the page. We only
look at headings and body text here, but expanding
the CSS yourself should not present any problems.

“You can create a class that defines a text
style and then use it over and over again”
Style other headings
Here you can see the style settings for the
h3 tag and the heading in use on the page.
The font-family, font-size, font-weight and
margin-bottom have all been set

Heading style
This is an h1 heading, the largest
that is available, so we have made
it big and bold. Choose your font
and font size carefully to get the
desired impact

Italic text
The p tag has already been set, so to
display italic text on the page we just
need to create an italictext class and set
the font-style to italic. All other settings
are inherited

CHOOSING A FONT
When you are designing a webpage, you can choose
any font on your computer, but be aware that if the
visitors to your website do not have the font, another will
be substituted and it may ruin your design. Safe fonts
include Georgia, Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Arial
Black, Comic Sans MS, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Verdana,
and Lucida Console.

01 Pick a font

02 Select a family

Using CSS you can set the font for all the text enclosed by <p></p> tags
on all webpages with this in your style.css file. Link to it in the page header
using <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css" />. This bit of
code sets the font family to Verdana.

When a font name contains spaces, you must put quotes around it or the
CSS won't work. It is also a good idea to offer an alternative font in case the
visitor to your site doesn't have the one you specified. Choose a family such
as serif (fancy) or sans-serif (plain).

03 Size and style

04 Define a class

The text may be fine at its default size, but if it isn't, you can set the size in
pixels. The size you need depends on the font, so experiment with 10px
to 16px. The font-style can be normal or italic and the font-weight can be
normal, bold, bolder or lighter.

There may be paragraphs that you want to make bold or italic, so here are
three classes that define three styles of text. It varies the font-style and
font-weight, but you could also create small text, large text, styles for panels,
captions for images and so on.

05 Use different classes

06 Define the headings

Step 4 created three CSS classes for the <p> tag. When you want text to
appear in one of these styles, you add a class parameter to the <p> tag. The
style is used for all the following text until you either change it with another
tag or end it with </p>.

In addition to body text, there are also headings using h1 to h6 tags. You
don't need to define all of them, just the ones you use. Do it exactly like the
p tag and set the font, size, style and so on. We've also reduced the bottom
margin below the header.

brief and to the point. People scan a page

like a circle or square. It is even possible to replace
it with an image that's specially created to fit in
with your site’s design and colour scheme using
list-style-image. You can change the font used to
display lists so they match the body text. If you have

used HTML lists you will have noticed that they are
indented, but with CSS you have finer control over
the positioning using padding and margins. You
can either tighten up the layout or space it out – it’s
your choice.

“With CSS you have finer control

01 Create a list

02 Boxed lists

Before you can style a list you will first need to
create one. The first step is to add a set of <ul></
ul> tags as shown. Inside these tags you will need
to add list, or <li> tags to place the list text. Add
as many as you need, with a minimum of four for
context. Inside each set of the list tags add the
desired text to populate and save.

You should have a separate file called style.css for
CSS code, so load it and create a new class called
list style as shown. It contains just one item called
list-style: square, but there are over 20 different
possible values. These include circle, lowerroman, disc, decimal, upper-latin, and others. Try
each one to see what they are like.

04 Style the text

05 Choose a background

03 Position the list
With those boxes in mind, we can position the
list within the space allocated to it on the page.
Padding and margin have been added to the list
style class and set to 10 and 0 pixels respectively.
Experiment with different values to see how they
affect the position of the list.

06 Inside vs outside

Notice in the last step that the list text has a
different font to the body text. That’s because no
style is set for lists. We defined the font and size
for the body text in a previous tutorial and we can
simply add ul to the p code so it uses the same
font and size as the body text.

Many HTML elements can have a background
colour and it is applied to both the content and
padding areas, but not the border or margin. A
background-colour of #9E2103 has been set, but
if you are not familiar with this notation, you can
use common names like red, yellow, blue and so
on. This is less flexible, though.

07 Add a border

08 Colour the border

09 Style up

As we’ve discussed, each HTML element can have
a border. We haven’t specified one so far, so one
hasn’t been drawn. However, we can easily define
one by setting border-width to the number of
pixels and border style to dotted, solid, dashed,
double, groove, ridge, inset or outset.

Most parts of the list can be coloured and this
includes the border. The border-colour has been
set to #600, which makes it stand out against the
red. It’s a good idea to specify the colour even
if it’s black, because default settings for web
browsers might be different.

The elements added so far, eg. margin, padding
and font sizes may not work exactly as you want.
So the next step is to fine-tune the margins and
padding and bump up the font-size. Experiment
with the different values until you get a finish that
you are happy with and save.

WorldMags.net

Web Design for Beginners 51

In the last step did you notice that the bullet blobs
are outside of the background colour? This is their
default position, but it’s possible to change this
and make them appear in the background area. In
this step, list-style-position is set to inside and this
makes the list look more attractive.

Turn lists into navigation bars
Every website needs some sort of navigation, so why not use CSS for it?

W

ebsite navigation is an important topic
and it is something that you need
to put some thought into as you are
designing your website. At one time we would
have used button images created in a paint or
photo program and then used JavaScript to create
a rollover effect when the mouse hovered over one.
But that’s yesterday’s technology and modern sites
use CSS instead.
A CSS navigation bar looks like a regular
unordered list in the HTML of the page, but using
CSS we can manipulate the list elements and turn

them into the website’s navigation. Instead of the
list running down the page, the list elements can
be displayed across it instead. We can style the links
just like any other text and create a custom look for
the navigation bar. The result looks nothing like its
original plain HTML layout and it really shows off the
power of CSS.

“The result looks nothing like its plain HTML
layout and it shows off the power of CSS”

A guide to CSS navigation menu bars

Mouse-over effects
We’ve sneaked in one final bit of code here. Using #navbar li
a:hover, a different colour is defined for when the mouse hovers
over a link in the navigation bar. It adds the finishing touch

Create an ID
The navigation menu only appears once on the page, so
we use an ID instead of a class. This #navbar turns a regular
list into a site navigation menu at the top of the page

Vertical to horizontal
Using float:left a vertical list of items is
displayed as a horizontal list. It is the key
component of this navigation menu and
it would not work without it. However,
display:inline is an alternative

Block links
The spacing between the items in the navigation bar
is created by setting a specific width for each item.
Links are turned into rectangular blocks and the
width determines their size

STRETCH IT TO FIT
In the finished screen shot the navigation bar
stretches across the full width of the page. There
are several ways to achieve this; in this case we
have simply chosen a width for the list items that
exactly, or near enough, fit across the page.
If you have more navigation items you will need
to reduce the width or make the page wider.

52 Web Design for Beginners

You can copy the code into your own web
pages and it will work fine. All you need to do is to
change the link text to correspond to the pages
or sections on your own site, and style the text to
fit in with the fonts and colours that you use. It is
really quite straightforward once you see how it
works for yourself.

01 Create a list

02 Make it plain

An unordered list (ul) is used to provide links to other sections of the
website. It’s all standard HTML and it’s exceedingly dull compared to CSS.
Try it and see. In the ul tag though, we have added id="navbar" and we’ll
use it to change the way the list is displayed.

In the last tutorial we saw how to style lists and the bullets can be removed
by setting list-style-type to none. The padding and margin can also be set to
zero. This produces a very plain list of links at the top of the page that’s not
very exciting.

03 Floating elements

04 Spread them out

Normally each list item is displayed on a separate line, but it is possible to
remove the line breaks by using float. Setting the list elements (#navbar li)
to float left causes them to be displayed one after the other on the same
line, like a navigation bar.

All the links are bunched up together and Step 3 doesn’t look much like a
navigation bar. What we need to do is to make each link a fixed width. We
define the a link within li of navbar (#navbar li a) as a block and set its width
to 100 pixels.

05 Style the text

06 Colour and decoration

Remember how we styled some text a while back? We can do the same
here. Add the formatting information to #navbar li a to change the way
that <a> links look in <li> items. Set the font size and weight, margin and
padding, and so on.

Three items have been added and immediately noticeable is the colour.
The text colour has been set to black and the background has been set to
mide-grey with colour and background-colour. Finally, text-decoration:none
removes the underline from the links.

position it left and right, set the size and so on, but
those are dated. If you use CSS to format images
instead, there are many more options available
to you. For example, you can add a border, set its
thickness and its colour. The spacing around each
side of the image can be individually adjusted, text
can be wrapped around it on the left or the right

“If you use CSS to format images, there are
many more options available to you”

A guide to CSS images

Float the image
If you want the image to appear within the
text with the words wrapped around it, use
float. The image can be floated left or right
and the text automatically moves to slot it in

There are many formatting options to
enhance your images
Width and height
The size of an image can be manually set
by entering the width and height in pixels.
However, enlarging or shrinking it will
affect the quality. It’s best with auto width
and height

Add a shadow
If you want to lift the image off the
page, add a shadow below it using
this command. Try different values
to see the effect they have. It only
works in new web browsers though

Define the margins
A single margin command makes all the
margins exactly the same. They don’t
have to be that way, though: each of the
sides of the image can have a different
margin, as shown here

CSS3 DROP SHADOWS
The drop shadow function box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px
#666; is new to CSS3 and will only work with newer
browsers. Visit http://caniuse.com to check support.
Old browsers ignore it. The first two numbers are
the horizontal and vertical shadow positions. Bigger
numbers make bigger shadows. The third number is
the amount of blur and the last is the colour.

and so on. The latest web browsers that are up to
speed with CSS version 3 can display advanced
image attributes like drop shadows that give the
page a 3D look.
Forget the old HTML way of doing things and
take advantage of CSS and its powerful features. Our
tutorial will guide you through the process.

01 Create the images

02 Insert the images

Load your paint program or photo editor and create the images for your
webpage. There may be a background image, as shown here, and one or
more other images to be displayed in the page. It is usually best to save
photos as JPEGs and illustrations as 256-colour PNGs.

Images are inserted into the HTML of the page using the img tag, with src
pointing to the filename. Add an alt attribute as an image title: it’s useful
for search engines. Where the image is now, it doesn’t look good. Add
class="imgright" to the img tag.

03 Build a class

04 Add some borders

Adding img.picright to the CSS file adds the class we need to format the
image. The float:right; causes the image to be displayed on the right –
float:left; would display it on the left. In both cases the following text will
wrap around the image on the left or right.

As with many other HTML elements, in CSS images can have borders. The
border-style can be solid, dotted, dashed and so on, the border-width can
be specified in pixels and the colour selected with border-colour. Use colour
names or for more controls hexidecimal codes eg #999999.

05 Define the margins

06 Size the images

You may find that the text runs right up to the image, which might not look
very attractive. It can be prevented by setting margins. We’ve exaggerated
the effect with a 30-pixel margin; 10 is usually fine. Margin-top, left, bottom
and right can be set separately if necessary.

If you don’t specify a size for the images, they will be displayed at whatever
size they are. In some situations, though, you might want to display an
image at a different size, such as when showing thumbnails. Set the width
and height to the number of pixels to make the image that size.

Style a two-column layout
Use the HTML and CSS skills you’ve learnt so far to create and style a two-column page layout

U

sing HTML and CSS to create and style a
two-column website layout – one of the
most common layouts – is surprisingly
straightforward and very flexible. Almost all
websites today use some kind of column layout
with at least a sidebar and main content areas. So
it’s one of the basic skills to have when designing
websites, and once you understand these
fundamentals you can move on to bigger and more
elaborate designs.
In this tutorial, we are going to open up our
favourite text editor (we will be using Adobe
Dreamweaver, but the humble NotePad or TextEdit
is fine) and learn how we can shorten, lengthen and

swap any column we need just by using CSS. Then
we will discuss CSS floats, why we use percentages
and a few other tips along the way.

“Almost all websites
use a column
layout with at least
a sidebar and main
content areas”

Taking a closer look

The sidebar

Let’s take a closer look at what we will achieve and summarise the
most important part of creating a two-column layout using HTML/CSS

The header
We’ll float the header left and give
it a 100% width to make sure it
spans the full width of our wrapper

Main content
The main content will be floated
left as we want this to be
positioned far left of our page.
Then some margins will give us
some white space

56 Web Design for Beginners

ANATOMY OF A CSS RULE
When we write CSS, we use ‘selectors’. A selector is
the HTML tag we want to style. Then within the curly
braces we have the property and its value. So ‘float:’
is the property and ‘left’ is its value. Both together
‘float: left;’ is what is called the declaration. When we
put everything together (selector and declaration) it’s
what we call a CSS ‘rule’. Another quick thing is the
fact that all tags (<p>, <div>, etc) are boxes that we
call elements and are either block level or inline level.
Every element follows the normal flow and stacks on
top of each other vertically. When we use floats, we
need to think of each element as a box that needs to
be positioned outside the normal document flow.

WorldMags.net

The sidebar area is floated right
and again we use margins to push
it away at the top, bottom, left and
right sides

WorldMags.net

01 Getting started
First thing we need to do is create new ‘index.html’ and ‘styles.css’ files and
place them in the same directory. It is considered best practice to also place
all your CSS files within their own folder called ‘css’ as some use separate
CSS files for certain things such as Internet Explorer-specific styles. However,
we will keep it simple here and leave them sitting in the same location.

03 The wrapper
With the ‘index.html’ file still open, lets add in a ‘wrapper’ div that will be
used to centre all our content on the screen later on using CSS. What we
have done here is use an ID (<div id=”) instead of using a class because this
is going to be a main part of our page’s structure and will only be used the
once throughout our code.

02 Linking the CSS
Now that we have our new index.html and styles.css files, we will need to
link them up together within the <head></head> tags of our HTML. So
open up the index.html file and just underneath the closing </title> tag,
type in your link to your CSS.

04 Header
Okay, the first real page section (element) we will add is the header. We
are going to give it an ID (‘<div id=’ called ‘header’) and place this just
underneath our wrapper div. Then we have added in a title of our section
within an ‘<h1>’ header tag so we can know what’s what.

05 Main content

06 Sidebar section

So next up we need to add a main content section that will be positioned
on the left side. Like we did in the last step we have used an ID called ‘main_
content’ and added it in just underneath our ‘header’. And again so we can
see what section is what, we have added in a title using the ‘<h1>’ tag.

The sidebar is next and this is the area that will be positioned over to the
right and would normally be used for extra navigation links or a search field
– things like that. So again we will use an ID called ‘sidebar’ and add it just
under the ‘main_content’ closing div ‘</div>’.

WorldMags.net

Web Design for Beginners 57

Build a WorldMags.net
site

08 CSS reset

07 The footer
Now the footer speaks for itself and will be our last HTML section we will be
adding. So again let’s give it an ID name of ‘footer’ and add it in underneath
the closing ‘main_content’ div. Then again place in a header tag using a
‘<h3>’. You will also notice we have added in an HTML comment to every
end div tag (</div>) to give us a clear indication of where each section ends.
This will help you if your HTML mark-up gets very busy.

Now open up your ‘styles.css’ file and what we are going to do first is add
what is called a ‘reset’. The reset uses the universal selector and this just
tells all browsers (including IE) to clear all default styles, such as padding,
margins, line-height etc. Doing this will give you a clean slate to work from.
001 /* reset */
002
003 * {
004 padding: 0;
005 margin: 0;
006
007 }

10 The header
09 Wrapper styles
Now the reason for our wrapper is to ‘wrap’ everything within a containing
section (element) so we can centre it within the viewpoint of our screen.
So here we have used margin to zero out the top and bottom margins and
allow CSS to automatically calculate the left and right space based on our
width. Our width will be 960px because that aligns up nicely with a screen
resolution of 1080 x 760px (lowest common denominator).
001 #wrapper {
002 width: 960px;
003 margin: 0 auto;
004 }

12 The sidebar styles

11 Main content styles
In this step we are going to give our ‘main_content’ some styles. First thing,
then, is to float it left. Then give it an off-white background colour and then
by using margins we can give it some breathing space – which is called
‘white space’. We then specify its width and height taking into consideration
the overall width of our wrapper so we have enough room for our sidebar.
001 #main_content {
002
float: left;
003
background: #f0f0f0;
004
margin: 10px 5px 10px 0;
005
width: 620px;
006
height: 630px;
007 }

58 Web Design for Beginners

Now, for the header section we are going to float it left and give it a width
of 100%, which will guarantee our header spans the whole width of our
‘#wrapper’. Then we push the header down 10px using margin. Here we
have used what is called shorthand CSS, which enables us to only pick the
top margin. Now give the background a colour and then 100px height.
001 #header {
002
float: left;
003
background: #f1f1f1;
004
margin: 10px 0 0 0;
005
width: 100%;
006
height: 100px;
007 }

The sidebar will be positioned to the right-hand side. This is at most
expected by the user/visitor, so it makes sense to float to right. We will then
use margins again to give us some white space. Our sidebar background will
be a darker grey than the rest and it will be a fixed width of 324px, which
should give us plenty of room for any inner content. Then we give it the
same height as the main content section.
001 #sidebar {
002
float: right;
003
margin: 10px 5px 5px 6px;
004
background: #ccc;
005
width: 324px;
006
height: 630px;
007 }

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net
13 The footer styles
The footer styles should be fairly straightforward now. However, we have a
new property to look at, which is the ‘clear:’ property. Setting this to ‘both’
will make all floated elements pump up over the footer allowing our footer
to sit where it should be. Then we float the footer to the left and give it
some dimensions.
001 #footer {
002
clear: both;
003
float: left;
004
background: #ddd;
005
width: 100%;
006
height: 100px;
007 }

14 The headers
If you view your layout within a browser you will see we have now got a nice
two-column layout with a sidebar and main content area. The only thing we
need to do now is push the titles(headers) of each section away from the
edges. So, we can easily achieve this by using padding on all header tags
using the same CSS rule.
001 h1, h2, h3 {
002
padding: 20px;
003 }

15 Moving the sidebar
Now say you wanted the sidebar over to the right, well, this is very easy to
achieve and all it takes is to change the float value of the ‘#main_content’
rule from ‘left’ to ‘right’. But what you want to be conscious of is naming
your divs. So, for instance, if we name our sidebar something like ‘<div
id=”left_side”>’ then this would now be a bit confusing when or if someone
else looks at your code.
001 #main_content {
002
float: right;
003
background: #f0f0f0;
004
margin: 10px 5px 10px 0;
005
width: 620px;
006
height: 630px;
007 }

16 Bigger two columns
As you can imagine, it’s very easy to make two larger content areas and
not have a sidebar at all – even though it can still be called ‘sidebar’. So in
your CSS, if we think about how much space we have to play with, which
is 960px, and divide that into two. However, then we have to compensate
for our margins, so it may take you some messing about to get the right
spacing without pushing anything out.

17 Be inspired

18 Research alternatives

Now you’ve finished your basic two-column layout, take at look at some of
your favourite websites and see which layout they employ. As shown above,
www.webdesignermag.co.uk uses a two-column layout too.

The two-column layout is in no way the be all and end all. On pages 36-39,
we explored how to create a three-column layout, and even one-page
scrolling websites (like above) are becoming more and more popular.

Create a header
Learn how to create a clean, simple and effective header for your website

H

aving clean and clear header for your
website can be the difference between a
successful and user-friendly experience
and a cluttered and disorganised website that no
one will want to visit again. You don’t want a firsttime user coming to your site and not know how
your navigation works, or your company branding
and logo hidden under a load of useless graphics or
text – it doesn’t even really matter how effective the
rest of your layout is.
Yes, this sort of thing has been known to happen
(more often that web designers would like to
admit), that is why so many designers are turning to
a relatively new role called user experience or ‘UX’. In

this tutorial we will take a look at how we can create
a simple, clean and useful header for your site to
make your website easier to navigate.

“You don’t want a
user coming to
your site not
knowing how your
navigation works”

How to make a header
Here are the most important things to consider
when creating a header for your web page

The hover state

Separators

The hover state is nicely styled
and can be easily changed
whenever needed just by
changing both the background
colour or font colour

Adding a separator to our
navigation links doesn’t
need to be pure CSS as we
did, but it is handy using the
‘border’ property

The logo
The logo can be either a graphic
or just text. You will also notice we
have used the same font for both
the logo and navigation

The background
Creating a textured background will
always help stand your web page
out from the crowd – gone are the
days of white backgrounds with
nothing but text and images

60 Web Design for Beginners

LOGO POSITIONING
One of the most important things to remember is to
make a feature of your branding, and crucially, your
logo. It is considered best practice to position your
logo in the top left-hand corner and make it link to
your home page (index.html). If it’s something you
consider to be common practice, then not putting
it there would frustrate the user. So when you
design and develop your header, you first need to
realise what the user would want or would expect
to be there. It’s also a good way of adding in more
important information such as phone numbers or
email addresses. The choice is yours, but be mindful of
not making the header look cluttered.

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net

01 Getting started

02 Linking the CSS

First thing we need to do is create new ‘index.html’ and ‘styles.css’ files and
place them in the same location. Because we will be using images for our
header, let’s also create an empty folder called ‘imgs’. Store the logo from
the disc within this ‘imgs’ folder and also the textured background file.

Now we have our index.html and styles.css files, we’ll need to link them up
within the ‘<head>’</head>’ tags of our HTML. Open index.html in your editor
and just underneath the ‘<title>’ tags place your link to your CSS. It’s good
practice to leave a HTML comment to denote where the CSS links will go.

03 Setting the wrapper

04 Header

Still in index.html, let’s add in a ‘wrapper’ div to centre all our content on the
screen. We’ve used an ID (<div id=”) because this is going to be a main part
of the page’s structure and will only be used only once throughout. If it was
going to be used multiple times, then we’d use a class (<div class”).

Now let’s add in our header section. So within the ‘wrapper’ div, create
another div ID called ‘header’. You will also notice we used HTML comments
to mark the ‘END’ of our divs. That way if our mark-up (HTML) gets too
messy, we will know what end div (</div>) belongs to what.

05 Adding the logo

06 Navigation list

Now let’s place our logo within the header section; you can use your own or
grab ours on FileSilo to have a play with. We are going to use an ID again and
call it ‘logo’. Then we will wrap it within an anchor tag and link it to our page
by adding in the index page within ‘<a href=”index.html”>’.

In this step we are going to add in the navigation. What we will use here is a
standard unordered list and each list item (<li>) will have a link to each page
using the ‘<a href=”’ attribute. Then we will give our unordered list a class
name of ‘navigation’.

WorldMags.net

Web Design for Beginners 61

Build a WorldMags.net
site
08 The CSS

07 Main content
We will now finish off our HTML markup with some content underneath our
header. Just underneath our closing header div ‘</div>’, let’s add in a div ID
of ‘main_content’ and add in a welcome title using header tags ‘<h2>’ and
then some dummy text using ‘<p>’ tags.

Now open up your ‘styles.css’ file and at the top put in our simple reset. The
reset does exactly that – resets every element to zero, which will clear all
the default styles that most browsers put on. Then, using the body tag we
can give our page a textured background using an image and leaving it to
repeat across the page. And then we set the ‘font-family’ and ‘size’.
001 * {
002 padding: 0;
003 margin: 0;
004 }
005
006 body {
007 background: url(‘imgs/bg.jpg’);
008 font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;
009 font-size: 12px;
010 }

10 The header
09 The wrapper
Now we are going to centre our header and content using the ‘wrapper’
div. What we are doing here is making sure we have no margin at the top
or bottom and automatically find the difference on the left and right that is
in relation to our fixed width – which we set to 960px. 960 pixels is mostly
used because it fits nicely within the lowest common denominator of screen
resolutions (1080 x 760).
001 #wrapper {
002
margin: 0 auto;
003
width: 960px;
004 }

11 The logo
Adding the logo is going to be very simple. All we are going to do is locate
our logo that we have inside our ‘imgs’ folder and then make sure it doesn’t
repeat. Then position it on the left by floating it left and then specify its
height and width. A thing to remember here is that if you don’t specify its
dimensions you will not see it on the webpage.
001 #logo {
002
background: url(‘imgs/sc_logo.png’) no-repeat;
003
float: left;
004
width: 200px;
005
height: 200px;
006 }

62 Web Design for Beginners

Now for our header we are going to float it left and give it a 100% width so it
spans the full width of our wrapper div, then give it a height of 250px. Let’s
also add in a red border so we can see the header more clearly and get a
better visual idea of where we need our logo and navigation, which we will
add in over the next few steps – then once happy we will remove it.
001 #header {
002
float: left;
003
width: 100%;
004
height: 250px;
005
border: 1px solid #f00;
006 }

12 The navigation
Now let’s style our navigation. We do this by floating the whole element
right then positioning it 150px down and then pulling it over to the
right using a negative margin of ‘-50px’. Never be worried about using
negative margins as they work very well. Then we give the navigation a
width of 600px.
001 .navigation {
002
float: right;
003
margin: 150px -50px 0 0;
004
width: 600px;
005 }

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net
14 Navigation anchors

13 Navigation buttons
At the moment our navigation looks nothing like a horizontal navigation
bar, more like a basic list of links. So let’s make it go horizontal by floating
each ‘<li>’ item left, which will push them all horizontal. Then we can take
away the default item bullets by specifying the ‘list-style’ being none.
001 .navigation li {
002
float: left;
003
list-style: none;
004 }

15 The content
Now let’s style our page content, which helps to keep our page looking like
a website. While we’re here let’s get sneaky and add some CSS3 properties
to make the background have rounded corners by using ‘border-radius: 6px’.
We then style the paragraphs give it some padding to both the paragraph
text and header tags.
001 #main_content {
002
float: left;
003
width: 900px;
004
height: 400px;
005
background: #fff;
006
border-radius: 6px;
007 }
008
#main_content p, h2 {
009
line-height: 22px;
010
margin-top: 10px;
011
padding: 20px;
012
}

Now we need to give each anchor tag some padding. Take off the underline
by specifying the text-decoration as ‘none’ and then create a separator using
‘border-right’. We can remove also the red border around the ‘header’. Then
we can add in a hover state that will change the background and text colour.
001 .navigation li a {
002
float: left;
003
color: #333;
004
padding: 6px 20px;
005
text-decoration: none;
006
border-right: 1px solid #333;
007
font-size: 16px;
008 }
009
010 .navigation li a:hover {
011
012
background-color: #333;
013
color: #fff;
014 }

16 Find Google Fonts
Looking at our navigation, we can clearly see that it doesn’t look very
attractive. So let’s spruce it up somewhat by heading over to Google Fonts
www.google.com/webfonts and type in ‘lobster’ within the search field
and you should see at least two choices of fonts. The one we want is the top
style. Then click the blue ‘add to collection’ button to the right and now it is
ready to use.

18 Google font-family

17 Apply the Google font
Now the next step here is to click the ‘use’ grey button located at the very
bottom right and scroll down the page slightly. What we have first is the
‘link’ tag line that will link straight to the Google font servers and will always
be available. That way you can guarantee everyone will be able to see your
chosen font. So click and drag over the link and press Ctrl/Cmd+C to copy
it to your clipboard. Then paste it into your ‘index.html’ file just underneath
our other CSS link within the ‘<head>’ tag.
001 <!-- CSS -->
002 <link rel=”stylesheet” href=”styles.css”>
003 <link href=’http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster’
rel=’stylesheet’
004 type=’text/css’>
005
006 </head>

Now let’s Ctrl/Cmd+C to copy the ‘font-family’ property and then open
up the ‘styles.css’ file and locate the ‘.navigation li a’ rule (a CSS rule is
everything within the curly brackets) and paste the new ‘font-family’
underneath the ‘font-size’ property.
001 .navigation li a {
002
003
float: left;
004
color: #333;
005
padding: 6px 20px;
006
text-decoration: none;
007
border-right: 1px solid #333;
008
font-size: 16px;
009
font-family: ‘Lobster’, cursive;
010 }

Create a sidebar
Learn how to create a clean navigation system for your website

A

sidebar is without doubt the area that
is most often created by web designers
because it’s the most needed. It can hold
all sorts of content: things such as extra navigation
links, a search field and perhaps some small
thumbnail images that relate to your website – it
can be anything.
So in this tutorial we’re going to create a simple
page layout that has a functional navigation and a
nice and simple sidebar that includes some content
within. We’re going to include within the sidebar a
list of links for that extra navigation we mentioned
and a search bar above and also some thumbnail
images at the bottom to act as though we have a

Flickr section – very useful for any photographybased sites. So open up your favourite text editor
and let’s get started.

“A sidebar can hold
all sorts of content:
extra navigation links,
a search field, even
some small images”

The width

A perfect sidebar

A thin-looking sidebar wouldn’t
help anyone unless you have no
intention of anything but small
thumbnail images

Your sidebar needs to be clean and crisp to
keep your visitors engaged
The search field
The sidebar is a great place to put
your search field – and you will see
this on most WordPress themes or
other blogging platforms

Navigation
Having a list of links for an extra
navigation will allow you to add
in links that you may not have
had the room to fit in the main
navigation menu

The thumbnails
We added this feature because you
see it all the time. People who have
a blog can use a plug-in that allows
them to feature their Flickr photos

64 Web Design for Beginners

STICK TO THE RIGHT
If you spend some time surfing the internet in
some detail, the chances are that you won’t see too
many websites with the sidebar fixed over to the
left side – it is far more likely to be over to the right.
Even though it is relatively easy to swap it over, you
wouldn’t be doing anyone any favours if you thought
you would be clever and original by plonking it
on the left – internet users are now accustomed
to seeing this section on the right-hand side of
their screens. If you’re struggling to add content
in the sidebar, then you can add a short summary
about you or your business or perhaps even a small
YouTube video about your site.

First thing we need to do is create new ‘index.html’ and ‘styles.css’ files and
place them in the same location (directory). And because we will be using
images for our sidebar, let’s also create an empty folder called ‘imgs’. Feel
free to carry on with what we created last time.

If you open up the index.html file and just underneath the ‘<title>’ tags,
place your link to your CSS. Then we want to add in a wrapper div that
will help us contain everything on the page and allow us to centre it all
using CSS.

03 The header

04 Navigation

Next we want to add in a header for our page and we do this by adding a
div with an ID of ‘header’. Then within the header we are going to put our
type-based logo that is wrapped within an anchor tag that links back to the
home page (index.html).

In this step we are going to add in the navigation. What we will use here is a
standard unordered list and each list item (<li>) will have a link to each page
using the ‘<a href=”’ attribute. Then we will give our unordered list a class
name of ‘navigation’.

05 Sidebar and search

06 Sidebar navigation

Let’s now add in our sidebar section. All we do here is create a div ID with
the name of ‘sidebar’ just underneath the closing header div ‘</div>’. Then,
using the code above, within our sidebar section let’s add in a search field
that will just sit there and look pretty.

Now what we need to do is now is add in what will be our sidebar
navigation. This is the exactly the same code as our top main navigation, so
it’s just a case of copying and pasting that into the sidebar. But we will need
to give it a different class name, which can be ‘sidebar_list’.

07 Sidebar images

08 The main content

We’ll now add some images to sit below our navigation list. We have the same
image here for both, set to the size of 100x100px. We've given them a class
name of ‘thumb’ so we can use CSS to position them better without relying
on the ‘img’ tag. Also we've given this section a title with the ‘<h3>’ tag.

To finish off our HTML markup, we will add in a main content section. Again
let’s use an ID and name it ‘main_content’. Then within the ‘main_content’
section we can add in a ‘welcome’ title accompanied by some dummy text
wrapped in a paragraph tag ‘<p>’.

10 The wrapper

09 The CSS
Open up your ‘styles.css’ file and at the top add in the universal selector that
will allow you to reset every element (<p>, <h1>, div, etc) to zero margin and
padding. Then using the ‘body’ tag we can set the background colour to an
off white ‘#f1f1f1’ and set our default font style and size.
001 * {
002 padding: 0;
003 margin: 0;
004 }
005
006 body {
007
background: #f1f1f1;
008
font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;
009
font-size: 12px;
010 }

11 The header & logo
We’re styling our header by giving it a 100% width with a height of 250px.
Adding the logo is also going to be very simple as we’ll only be using text
for now. We've given ours a drop shadow using the ‘text-shadow’ property.
001 #header {
002
float: left;
003
width: 100%;
004
height: 250px;
005 }
006 #logo h1{
007
font-size: 35px;
008
float: left;
009
margin-top: 130px;
010
color: #dac91a;
011
text-shadow: 1px 1px 3px #333;
012 }

66 Web Design for Beginners

So with our wrapper acting as a container for all our page content, we can
centre everything using a fixed width and margin. We’re specifying 0 pixels
on top and bottom, with auto margins on the left and right. This is an easy
and most often the best way of centring your page on your screen.
001 #wrapper {
002
margin: 0 auto;
003
width: 960px;
004 }

12 The navigation
Now let’s style our navigation. We can do this by floating the whole element
right, positioning it 150px down and then pulling it over to the right using a
negative margin of ‘-50px’. Then we give the navigation a width of 600px. To
bump everything to a horizontal position we float all the ‘<li>’ left, then create
our button separator by adding a ‘border-right’ to the ‘navigation li a’ selector.
001 .navigation {
002
float: right;
003
margin: 150px -50px 0 0;
004
width: 600px;
005 }
006 .navigation li {
007
float: left;
008
list-style: none;
009 }
010 .navigation li a {
011
float: left;
012
color: #333;
013
padding: 6px 20px;
014
text-decoration: none;
015
border-right: 1px solid #333;
016
font-size: 16px;
017 }

14 Google fonts

13 Navigation hover state
At the moment our navigation looks nothing like a functional navigation
menu and it still needs a couple of things added. The hover state will be the
first thing we are going to add here, and then in the next step we will shoot
over to Google fonts to download the ‘lobster’ font and use that.
001 .navigation li a:hover {
002
003
background-color: #333;
004
color: #fff;
005 }

15 The sidebar
Now in this step we are going to style our sidebar. So first we are going to
float the sidebar over to the right and set a fixed height and width. Then
we can style the ‘<h3>’ header tag and just push that off the left side using
padding. Then give the text a dark grey colour of ‘#333’.
001 #sidebar {
002
float: right;
003
width: 300px;
004
height: 100%;
005
background: #fff;
006 }
007
008 #sidebar h3 {
009
padding-left: 20px;
010
color: #333;
011 }

17 The search field
In this step let’s style our search field. First of all we push it down slightly and
then make sure anything underneath it is 50px away. Then we slightly push
it away from the left edge using 20px. And lastly we give the input field
some padding to make it a bit more attractive.
001 #search_form {
002
003
margin: 10px 0 50px 20px;
004 }
005
006
#search_form input{
007
008
padding: 5px;
009 }

Now let’s go to google.com/webfonts and search for ‘lobster’. Add it to your
collection and click ‘use’. Then add the ‘<link=’ code to the index.html file just
underneath your main CSS link. Then locate the ‘.navigation li a’ rule and add
in the ‘font-family’ property. Do the same for your ‘#logo’ rule.
001 <!-- CSS -->
002 <link rel=”stylesheet” href=”styles.css”>
003 <link href=’http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster’
rel=’stylesheet’
004 type=’text/css’>
005
006 .navigation li a {
007
float: left;
008
color: #333;
009
padding: 6px 20px;
010
text-decoration: none;
011
border-right: 1px solid #333;
012
font-size: 16px;
013
font-family: ‘Lobster’, cursive;
014 }

16 Sidebar list
Style the sidebar navigation list by pushing it away from the edges using a
20px margin. Add a subtle dotted line using the ‘border-bottom’ property.
001 .sidebar_list {
002
margin: 20px;
003 }
004
005 .sidebar_list li {
006
list-style: none;
007
margin: 10px;
008
padding-bottom: 10px;
009
border-bottom: 1px dotted #ddd;
010 }
011
012 .sidebar_list li a{
013
text-decoration: none;
014
color: #333;
015
font-size: 13px;
016 }

18 Finishing off
To finish, we need to style our thumbnail images. So we float them left so
they bump up to each other and then space them out by using margin.
001 .thumb {
002
float: left;
003
margin: 22px;
004
border: 1px solid #fff;
005
box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px #999;
006 }

Add content to your website
Learn how you can add content to the main area of your website

A

dding content to your website is either
done dynamically using a content
management system (CMS) or by hand.
Either way, you are going to have to learn how it’s
styled and what options you have. For instance, will
you have just text or text with images? How about
a video that’s either embedded using YouTube’s, or
your own flash or HTML5 player?
Of course your choices should be dependent
on what niche your website caters for and thus
knowing who will be visiting your website. So in
this tutorial, we will add a few elements of content
where one will include a video (which you can grab
whatever video you want, you don’t have to use our

one) and also some text and an image. So open up
the index.html and styles.css files within your text
editor and follow these simple steps.

“Your content
choices should be
dependent on the
niche audience your
website caters for”

Content is king
Let’s check out the most important parts of adding
content to your webpage

The top section

The width

It’s a good idea to add some text about
your website so users can see what you
are all about before going any further

You will need to think about
the width of your main
content area(s) and plan
ahead accordingly

The middle section
We have added a video from
YouTube here, but of course this
could just as easily be a image of
your company or yourself!

The bottom section
The bottom section is again used as
a text-based section that describes
the middle section video

68 Web Design for Beginners

THE RIGHT STUFF
Adding the right amount of content to any website
is vital and can mean the difference of having a
successful, clean website to a cluttered and confusing
one. The layout needn’t be the main concern here
as you can have multiple columns throughout. But
it’s the white space and the way that your sections
are aligned that will give your web page a better and
more readable layout. We also used horizontal rules
to add separators to section out our content even
further. But there is no real need to use a horizontal
rule; we can just as easily use an image here or in
some cases a bottom border. Just remember that if
there’s no content, you won’t get many visitors.

WorldMags.net

02 Main content header
01 Getting started
Open the Sidebar index.html file online or carry on from last time and you will
see we have most of the template done. We have a logo, a navigation and the
sidebar to the right. On the left we have our content area.

Now in this step we are going to give our main content area a title that will
welcome everyone to the website. We do this very easily by adding in a
‘<h2>’ tag and a nice message within. What we will do is use CSS later to see
what we can do to make this look a little nicer.
001 <h2>Hi, Welcome to my website</h2>

04 Adding an image
Now we need to add some ‘welcome’ text. This is normally a good way of
letting the user know what your website is all about from the off. Here we
will just wrap about three or four sentences within some ‘<p>’ tags.

Now we can add in an image within our welcome text. The idea here is to
have a small thumbnail image of something that relates to the website.
So place your image tag ‘<img src=’ above the welcome text just sitting
underneath the header. Then we will use CSS later to float it to the right.
001 <img src=”imgs/thumbnail.jpg” height=”100” width=”100”
class=”main_thumb”>

05 Styling our content

06 Content image

03 Welcome text

Let’s open up our ‘styles.css’ file. We can point to the ‘#main_content’ div
and then hock onto the ‘p’ tag. We can then use multiple selectors here and
use the same style properties and values for the<h2> tag.
001 #main_content p, h2 {
002
line-height: 22px;
003
margin-top: 10px;
004
padding: 20px;
005
width: 350px;
006

}

Now let’s float the image over to the right and add some styles to it. We are
going to use the same CSS as we did on the sidebar thumbnails. Then we’re
going to make sure we have enough white space around the image.
001 .main_thumb {
002
float: right;
003
margin: 40px;
004
border: 1px solid #fff;
005
box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px #999;
006 }

WorldMags.net

Web Design for Beginners 69

site
08 The main content height

07 Video
Next we want to add the video to our main content area. Now we can get
really technical and use an HTML5 or flash player here, but to keep things
really simple, we can shoot over to youtube.com and copy and paste the
embed code within our ‘index.html’ page. Then we want to be able to shift
this video about using CSS, so it would make sense to wrap a div around it
with an ID of ‘video’.
001 <div id=”video”>
002 <iframe width=”420” height=”315” src=”http://www.youtube.com/
embed/kNn44gHqanM” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen></iframe>
003 </div>

Now first thing you will notice is that the video is now hanging out at the
bottom of our content area. This is because on our ‘#main_content’ rule
we specified a fixed height of ‘500px;’ So all we need to do now is locate
that rule within our ‘styles.css’ file and change it from ‘height: 500px;’ to
‘height: 100%’;
001 #main_content{
002
float: left;
003
height: 100%;
004
width: 630px;
005
background: #fff;
006
border-radius: 6px;
007
margin-bottom: 40px;
008 }

09 Positioning the video
All we are going to do here is position the video using CSS. Now it makes
sense to float the video left. Then we are going to use margin to push it away
from the edges and anything that may be surrounding the video will now
have a generous amount of white space. Then let’s add a black 5px border to
finish off our video.
001 #video {
002
float: left;
003
margin: 20px;
004
border: 5px solid #000;
005 }

10 Horizontal rule
What we are going to do now is add a separator just above the video. This
will be easily styled using CSS, so we won’t need to depend on some graphic
design software such as Photoshop or Fireworks. It’s simply an HTML tag
called a horizontal rule ‘<hr>’ and we can add that just above the video div
within our ‘index.html’ file.
001 <hr>
002 <div id=”video”>

11 Styling the horizontal rule
Styling the horizontal rule ‘<hr>’ is going to be a very simple task, but it can
leave you scratching your head at times. For instance, if you want to increase
its height, you can’t just call ‘height: 10px’ – we have to instead call upon its
‘border’ property like ‘border: 5px solid #ddd’. But let’s keep it simple and
decrease its width, give it a grey colour and push it away from the left edge
using ‘margin-left’.
001 hr {
002 color: #ddd;
003 width: 570px;
004 margin-left: 20px;
005 }

70 Web Design for Beginners

12 Adding more content
So now you should get the idea of how and what we can add for our main
content. To get a real feel of it, let’s add something underneath our video.
What we can do then is add in another thumbnail image. So the best way
would be to use the same image but give it a different class name of ‘main_
thumb2’ and place this directly under our closing div of our ‘video’.
001 <img src=”imgs/thumbnail.jpg” height=”100” width=”100”
class=”main_thumb2”>

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net
13 More text
So the next step would be to add in some more text that could be used for
a summary/excerpt of our video. Underneath our new thumbnail image,
place some more dummy text that is wrapped within paragraph tags ‘<p>’
with a class name of ‘vid_excerpt’ so we can style it using CSS.
001 <img src=”imgs/thumbnail.jpg” height=”100” width=”100”
class=”main_thumb2”>
002 <p class=”vid_excerpt”>It is a long established fact that a reader
will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’,
making itlook like readable English.
003
</p>

14 Styling the content
What we need to do now is style our new content using some simple CSS.
So, open up your ‘styles.css’ file and position our thumbnail image first. We
will float it left and then give it a 40px margin all around. Then to finish it off
we can give it the same subtle drop shadow as the other thumbnail we used
in the sidebar.
001 .main_thumb2 {
002
float: left;
003
margin: 40px;
004
border: 1px solid #fff;
005
box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px #999;
006 }

15 The excerpt
Now all we need to do is float our video excerpt to the right and give it some
margins with 50px to the right, and 40px to the bottom.
001 .vid_excerpt {
002
float: right;
003
margin: 0 50px 40px 0;
004
}

16 Bottom content
When looking at our HTML, it would make more sense to wrap our bottom
thumbnail and excerpt content within its own div. That way we can have
more control of this section if at all we need to position it further. So, create
a div with an ID of ‘bottom_content’ and make sure you use an HTML
comment to mark the ending div ‘</div><!-- END bottom content -->’
001 <div id=”bottom_content”>
002 </div><!-- END bottom content -->

17 Adding another divider
Now what we want to do is add in another horizontal rule ‘<hr’> above the
excerpt text so we can then section out the video properly. So just above
the thumbnail image link, place in your ‘<hr>’ tag. But before we view it in
the browser, we need to go back into our CSS and float the ‘hr’ tags left. This
will push the bottom one underneath the video.
001 hr {
002 color: #ddd;
003 width: 570px;
004 margin-left: 20px;
005 float: left;
006 }

18 Going further
As we said in the intro text to this tutorial, it’s down to you as to what
your content should include. Later in this book we explore adding maps,
newsletters, social media icons and more!

Add content to your footer
Finish off your first site with a footer to be proud of

I

n the past, the humble footer was not much
more than a slim strip of colour with nothing
more interesting than the copyright text
written within. But in many modern websites, we
have seen a huge improvement in footer designs
and the content held within them.
These days, they are a lot higher and contain all
sorts of content, which can include contact forms,
newsletter sign-up fields, social media integration
and much more. Ours for instance, in addition to a
newsletter sign-up field and generic About Us text,
features another set of links for navigation, so our

readers don’t have to scroll back to the top or to the
sidebar if they want visit another page.
As crazy as it sounds (and this would have
sounded incredibly crazy no more than a few
years ago), the footer has really taken the modern
web by storm and has now developed into an area
that needs good planning – like all parts of your
website, it is important to offer the right amount
of content without confusing the user. So in this
tutorial we will build a simple footer and include
some useful content that you would most likely see
in a modern layout.

Dissecting the footer
The most important things to keep in
consideration for a good footer

Navigation

The newsletter field

Having a list of links for an extra
navigation will allow your users to
click through other pages without
needing to scroll up

We added this feature because it
would make sense for people to learn
more about your business/service. A
contact form here is also a good idea

The about text
The about text is a great way of
letting people know what you are
about if and when they are viewing
the content within your footer

SHORTHAND CSS
Over the course of this tutorial we
have used a lot of shorthand CSS.
The reason being is it’s quicker to
write and decreases your
style sheet's file size – even if it’s
only very small. The shorthand is
used for margin and padding, and
there is a lot more you can do with
it that we haven’t covered. So let’s
take a margin declaration for an
example. It works in a clockwise
direction, so ‘margin: 10px 20px
30px 40px’ would mean 10 pixels
top, 20 pixels right, 30 pixels
bottom and 40 pixels left. So top,
right, bottom, left. Then we can get
even more technical by only using
two values such as: ‘margin: 20px
30px’. Now this means 20 pixels top
and bottom, then 30 pixels right
and left. And lastly if we just use
one value such as: ‘margin: 20px’
would simply mean 20 pixels all
around to whatever element (div)
was specified.

03 Footer links

01 Getting started

02 About us

Open up your ‘index.html’ file from the last
project and scroll down to the very bottom of the
document. The first we are going to do here is
just underneath our closing ‘main_content’ div,
add in a div with an ID of ‘footer’.
001 <div id=”footer”>
002 </div><!-- END footer -->

In this step we are going to add some ‘about
us’ text that will be positioned to the left of our
footer. So first thing to do would be to create a div
with a class name of ‘about_txt’ within our footer
ID making sure we add on a HTML comment to
the closing div. For content, we will start with a
‘<h4>’ header tag that includes the words ‘about
us’. Then underneath that we will add in some
dummy text that is wrapped within paragraph
tags ‘<p>’.
001 <div class=”about_txt”>
002 </div><!-- END about txt -->

04 Newsletter sign up
Many websites would have either a contact form
or newsletter sign up field within their footer.
What we will do is keep it simple and add in a
newsletter sign up field. We will give it an ID name
of ‘newsletter’ and we will place this straight
under the footer links. We can then position this
later over to the right using CSS.
001 <form id=”newsletter” action=””
method=”get”>
002 <input id=”search_term” type=”text”
003 placeholder=”newsletter sign up....” />
004 <input class=”submit_button”
005 type=”submit” value=”sign up”>
006
</form>

05 Footer background
Now we have finished our HTML mark-up, but if
we viewed it in the browser now it would look a
bit of a mess! So let’s open up the ‘styles.css’ file,
scroll down to the very bottom and start adding
some CSS for our footer. First thing we can do is
clear the floats so it pops underneath everything
above and give it some dimensions and a
background colour of white.
001 #footer {
002
clear: both;
003
height: 200px;
004
width: 100%;
005
background: #fff;
006
margin-bottom: 20px;
007 }

08 Finishing the navigation
07 List items
Now style the list items‘<li>’. Here we are
removing the default bullet points and then
floating all the items left, which will push each
one up and next to each other giving us a
horizontal alignment. Then using ‘margin-left’ we
can create some space between each other.
001 .footer_links li {
002
list-style: none;
003
float: left;
004
margin-left: 20px;
005 }

It is always a good idea to place your site’s
navigation within the footer so the user doesn’t
need to scroll all the way up to the top to
navigate your site. So let’s use an unordered list
and give it a class name of ‘footer_links’ and place
it just underneath the 'about' text.
001 <ul class=”footer_links”>
002
<li><a href=””>home</a></li>
003
<li><a href=””>about</a></li>
004
<li><a href=””>blog</a></li>
005
<li><a href=””>portfolio</a></li>
006
<li><a href=””>services</a></li>
007
<li><a href=””>contact</a></li>
008 </ul>

Now we’re going to finish off our footer
navigation. What we need to do is remove the
default underline and then give the text a light
grey colour. Then for our hover state, let’s just
change the colour of the text to black ‘#000’,
giving us a subtle rollover effect.
001 .footer_links li a {
002
text-decoration: none;
003
color: #333;
004 }
005
.footer_links li a:hover {
006
color: #000;
007
}

WorldMags.net

06 The links
In this step let’s style our footer links so they
look more like a horizontal navigation list. We
are going to float it left and push it down using
margin and give it 20px space at the bottom.
Then let’s give it a width of 370px.
001 .footer_links {
002
float: left;
003
margin: 90px 0 20px 0px;
004
width: 370px;

09 About text
Styling the 'about' text is going to be very
simple. We first float it left and then give it a
width of 250px. We then give it some padding
to allow some white space all around. One thing
to remember by using padding is it will make
the box element (‘div’) 20 pixels bigger as the
padding effects the inner element, not the outer
element, and pushes it out.

WordPress has been given one of its most significant
updates yet, but is it really all that different? What’s
really new in WordPress 4.0?

W

ordPress 4.0 includes a
selection of new
features and security
fixes to help bring your blog or
website right up to date. Not only
have improvements been made to
the theme customiser view and
media library interface to enhanced
media handling in the visual
posting view and a brand new
interface for installing plugins, you’ll
also find changes to the TinyMCE UI
when creating a new post. It is now
even possible to select a language
when you install WordPress 4.0 for
the first time. Enhancements to
managing images and videos helps

76 Web Design for Beginners

to save time with previews, while
browsing for new plugins has
become a far better experience,
allowing you to see small previews
of the plugins.
In the background, various
security fixes have been made,
ensuring that your blog, your posts
and any user data is protected
against online intruders.
Remember to make sure your
blog is up to date, and this means
reviewing plugins regularly as well
as making a backup before you
upgrade. If you’ve been holding off
on some recent updates, you
shouldn’t miss WordPress 4.0!

Get to know the 4.0 Dashboard
A new look tells you everything you need to know when you log in to WordPress
At irst glance the Dashboard may not seem all that diferent in WordPress
4.0, but on closer inspection you should spot the Welcome panel, where a
collection of shortcuts can be found.
This panel is ideal for newcomers to WordPress because it provides
shortcuts for adding widgets, installing a new theme, writing a new post
and adding an about page, as well as managing widgets and menus, turning
comments on and of and more. If you’re a more experienced user then the
panel can be dismissed.
Also available to you on the Dashboard is the At a Glance panel, your
blog’s comments Activity, the Quick Draft box and the WordPress News,
which is useful for spotting when new updates are imminent. These are all

customisable as they were before, you are able to drag and drop for your
own liking. You can use the Screen Options to determine which boxes
appear and which remain hidden.
Further items will be added to the Dashboard as you install plugins.
Several prominent apps add important “at a glance”-style information to the
Dashboard, such as Jetpack’s visitor stats plugin.

Upgrade to WordPress 4.0 for the latest features
If you’re blog is already running WordPress, ensure your database is backed up before you
do anything else. Then sign into the Dashboard, find the notification informing you that
WordPress 4.0 is available, this will be displayed across the top of the page. Click the link to
begin the upgrade process. This will be the same whenever there is any new update available
for you to install.
After the update completes, you’ll be presented with the new Dashboard page. Before
proceeding make sure you check your plugins and themes for any available updates to
ensure full compatibility with the new version of the blog software. It might be that some
plugins may need to be disabled until the developers release compatible updates. Similarly,
there is a chance that you will need to choose a new theme.

“Some plugins may need to be
disabled until the developers release
compatible updates”

Creating posts

Blogging made easier
WordPress 4.0 has improved tools for creating
and posting new articles
Improvements to the way in which you compose posts in WordPress 4.0 can be a beneit
to new bloggers and those using WordPress as the publishing system for their top-rated,
busy website. At a glance, there are very few diferences with the previous version of
WordPress, but these improvements have been gradual over the past couple of years, and
as such are more secure and stable here.
In the Add New Post screen you’ll still ind the title box, the option to edit the Permalink,
which is a vital tool in your SEO strategy, and an option to add images using the Add
Media button. You may also prefer to view all of the available buttons in the TinyMCE text
editor, which is possible by simply using Toolbar Toggle.
A notable recent addition to WordPress is the Format toolbar, which can be used to
create post types such as standard, images-focused, video posts, galleries and more. You’ll
ind these work best when they are supported by your blog theme.

01: Use full page editing
Use the ‘Distraction Free Writing’ button to take the WordPress
post editor box full-screen, and enjoy a completely new way of
writing your blog.

02: Format your posts
Use post formats to style the published article appropriately – for
instance, a video post might have the clip at the very top of the
page. This helps you keep page styles consistent.

03: Visual Posting

Customising the look and feel of your blog posts has never been easier

The Visual Editor now gives you a better idea of how a blog post
will appear when published, with accuracy determined by the
active theme.

Revised Media Library
Changes to the WordPress media library make choosing images easier
One key addition to WordPress 4.0 is an
improvement to the Media Library. It is now
possible to view a larger-resolution version of an
uploaded image and make the necessary changes
with ease.
Improvements in how your images are handled
in the Edit screen, Media>Library>{Select your
image}>Edit Image, meanwhile allow you to make
and save edits without worrying whether or not
the changes you make will be applied. Although
it isn’t advisable to edit images on the server of a
busy website, sometimes it cannot be avoided, if
so, we would advise that your image editing takes
place on your computer or tablet.
You can also add a new title for the image, set a
caption to be displayed when it is embedded in
a post as well as display alt text when the image
doesn’t load. A description is also useful!
Whether you’re editing images or words you
can cycle between attachments uploaded by
using the arrows in the top-right corner of the
Attachment Details view.

Top tip

“The software will display the video preview,
as it would on the sites it originates”

Easily embed videos
Now there is no need to preview embedded videos
One great way to attract readers and ensure
they hang around is to embed clips from video
sharing services into your posts. A new feature
in WordPress 4.0 ofers a reined method of
viewing these video clips.
In the previous versions of WordPress an
embedded video was represented by a big
grey block, which provided a useful guide
to the size and positioning of the clip. After
updating to WordPress 4.0 the software will
display the video preview in your draft post
just as you would see it on the site it originates
from, YouTube or WordPress.tv for example.
You will no longer have to wait for a post
preview to load because you can preview the
video clip in the editor.
Although editing options are limited, there
are some choices available. If the video you
embedded is the wrong one, you can click the
pencil icon in the top left of the video preview
to open the edit screen and input a diferent
URL. WordPress only requires the URL rather
than the embed code. Should you want to
remove the video, simply click the X button.

Top tip

New user interface takes the pain out of plugin installation
Installing plugins can be a stressful experience.
After backing-up your database and iles, you then
need to ensure the plugin you’re about to install
is the best option for your blog. You may run it
on a test blog irst to make sure that there are no
inadvertent side-efects.
With WordPress 4.0, the developers Automattic
have introduced a new user interface that will
alleviate some of the stress by presenting available
plugins with a use preview that gives more
information than was previously available to you.
Now when you open the Plugins>Add New
screen, you will be presented with a selection
of Featured plugins, while a second tab displays
Popular plugins. Descriptions, ratings and update
information is provided, along with compatibility
details. To ind out more, click More Details, and
when you’re happy you can click Install Now to
add the plugin to your blog.
A useful new feature for anyone running
multiple blogs is Favourites, which means if you
sign in through your blog, you can view any
plugins that you marked as a favourite, making it
easy to ind in future.

When checking new
plugins, always view the

Get the language right
Adjust your language settings for your contributors
If you run a blog that is targeted at a foreign country, and have a team of bloggers who
speak the language of that region, then it might be a wise strategy to ensure that they
can use WordPress efectively. The best way to do this is to set up the blog software
using their preferred language, which is now an option when you install WordPress 4.0
onto a new server.
You may already be familiar with the WordPress installation screen, which you are
presented with as you open your domain name in your browser after uploading the
latest unzipped version of the blog software, we will explain how to do so over the next
few pages. Setting your preferred language is the irst option here. If you’re used to
using automated installers in cPanel or similar server admin tools, the language option
will also be found here.
Once the language is set, it cannot be changed without reinstalling, so ensure you
have selected the right option.

“You can now get a full preview in
the Theme Customizer”

Live widgets

Previewing widgets
Get the best preview of your theme yet – with widgets!
WordPress 4.0 features a few improvements to the Theme Customizer, which can be
accessed in Appearance>Customize. Previously this was limited to simply changing colours
and the site title, now it is a far more powerful tool that can demonstrate the impact of any
installed widgets on your chosen blog theme, as long as it is compatible with live widget
previews, before you have installed it.
The advantage of this is clear. Where once you would have added a widget, saved it and
then quickly refreshed your blog – probably in a new browser tab – to see how it looked
and whether or not it had altered your blog layout now you can get a full preview in the
Theme Customizer before rolling out the changes to your readers.
We think that this is one of the most important new developments in WordPress 4.0, and
once you’ve tried it out we’re certain you will agree!

01: Customise your blog
Access the Theme Customizer via Appearance>Customize. Click
Widgets to view available widgets for your blog theme sidebars.
You can change them in the Widgets Settings.

02: Adding a widget
Click Add a Widget to display the widgets you can use, and
conigure the one you want to use. Observe how it updates as
conirm options. Take time to try the diferent options.

03: Save your changes
Widgets can be reordered by clicking and dragging and like other
changes will update in the preview. When you’re happy with your
post click Save & Publish.

Adjust your Screen Options
Customise your WordPress 4.0 experience by
configuring screen options
How do you use WordPress? For most, it is a case
of sign in, scramble around looking for the link or
feature you’re looking for on the Dashboard or
New Post page, write your post, and then logout.
With the addition of more and more plugins over
time, this process can become increasingly slow.
The reason for this is simple: you’re not using
WordPress right. Using the Screen Options
button, available at the top of almost every admin
screen in the Dashboard, you can customise the

blogging software’s back-end to see only what
you need.
For instance, you’ve installed several plugins
to your WordPress 4.0 blog, and the Dashboard
is beginning to look a bit cluttered. All you need
to do in this situation is open the Screen Options
box at the top of the browser window, and disable
items that you don’t need to see, don’t use, or
don’t need to access through the Dashboard. Click
the Screen Options button when you’re done.

WordPress can be installed in five minutes, when
you know what you are doing. However, for those
not so well acquainted with the WordPress platform,
the process is a little more in-depth. Here we look
at the basics, namely where to download the latest
version of WordPress and how to install.
We also take a more in-depth look at setting
up a MySQL database and how to transfer files,
ready for installation, via an FTP client. Finally, we
run through the installation process and take a
peek at how to modify some of WordPress’s
essential settings.

WorldMags.net

01 Get WordPress

02 Web host account

03 Create a database

The first step to a great blog is downloading and
installing the platform. To download the latest
version of WordPress, head to wordpress.org/
download, click Download WordPress and save
the file to the desktop.

Before installing WordPress, a database needs
to be created. We are going to demonstrate a
typical setup using cPanel. First of all you’ll need
to log in to your web host account; these details
should have been provided by your web host.

Locate the Database section and MySQL
Database Wizard. Create a database, add a name
in New Database and press Next Step. Now add
a username and password, then press Next Step.
Now click All Privileges and Next Step.

04 Database details

05 Settings

06 Get connected

Head to the location of the WordPress download
and locate wp-config-sample.php. Rename the
file 'wp-config.php' and then open it in a text
editor. At the top under MySQL settings is where
the database and details need to be added.

The only settings that need to be changed are
‘DB_NAME’, ‘DB_USER’ and ‘DB_PASSWORD’.
Now substitute the putyourdbnamehere,
usernamehere and yourpasswordhere with the
appropriate text. Now save the file.

Now upload all the WordPress files to the desired
web space using FTP. Open FileZilla and go to
File>Site Manager and enter the Host address, ie
ftp.mywebsitename.co.uk and username and
password as provided by your host. Press Connect.

07 Create directory

08 Transfer files

09 Installation script

There will be two windows, the left displaying
local files and the right showing files on the server.
Double-click the www folder in the top-right pane
to get to the root. Right-click the bottom-right
pane, select Create directory and name.

Double-click the folder just created. Go to the left
windows and use both to locate the WordPress
download. Make sure the WordPress folder lowest
down the structure is selected. Select all files, rightclick and select Upload to transfer the files.

After all the files have been uploaded, open a
browser and enter www.yoursite.co.uk/blog/
wp-admin/install.php. ‘Yoursite.co.uk’ is the
domain name where WordPress is installed and
‘blog’ is the name of the folder.

Domain name
and web space
To get a WordPress blog
online, a user needs their own
web space and a domain name
The first requirement of any WordPress installation
is web space. There are thousands of web hosting
companies that'll supply space for a small fee.
However, to determine which web hosting package
to choose, the user needs to decide how much web
space is required and the expected traffic. Typically,
users can get 200MB of web space and gigabytes of
traffic for a very small fee. But if more space is likely
to be needed, eg for a photo blog, go for more.
A small UK company that provides cheap and
efficient hosting is Z-Host (www.z-host.co.uk). It
provides packages from as little as £15 a year (100MB
of web space and 10GB of monthly traffic), which is
perfect for first time bloggers. Alternatively, choose
1GB of web space and 40GB of monthly traffic for
£60 a year. At the other end of the scale, a popular
choice is web designer Media Temple (www.
mediatemple.net). This offers packages from $20 a
month (approx £15) but offers gigabytes of storage
and 1TB network transfer rates. Other reputable web
hosts to consider are Fasthosts (www.fasthosts.
co.uk), 1&1 (www.1and1.co.uk) and Heart Internet
(www.heartinternet.co.uk).
To host a WordPress blog at a desired URL, for
example mywebsite.co.uk, a domain name needs to
be purchased. Try www.123-reg.co.uk, which offers
.co.uk domain names from £2.99 and .com domain
names from £9.99 a year. Another well-respected
domain name supplier is Easily (www.easily.co.uk).
If the prospect of finding web space and getting
a domain name seems like a lot of hard work, you
could always go for the hosted option. Go to www.
wordpress.com, click Sign Up Now and all that’s
needed is an email address. This gives a new user
a unique WordPress URL, for example myname.
wordpress.com, and hosts the account.

10 It’s the dashboard

11 New password

Now add a Blog Title, your email address, click the
Allow… checkbox and press Install WordPress.
Press Log In to skip to the log-in screen, enter
the details just given and hit Log In to view the
WordPress Dashboard.

WordPress automatically displays a notice telling
the user that they are using the auto-generated
password. Now add a new password under
About Yourself (under Users in the sidebar), enter
again and then press Update Profile.

12 General Settings

13 Writing and reading

Click Settings to extend the menu and select
General. This section allows users to change the
Blog title and tagline, as seen in the header. There
is the option to change the original email address
added at setup.

The Writing settings includes the option to choose
the default category. This will be applied when a
post is not given a category. There’s also an option
to set up remote publishing. This allows users to
post from a desktop without logging in.

Find a domain name to create an identity for your blog

14 Media Settings
Try the free ‘no hassle’ option at www.wordpress.com

86 Web Design for Beginners

The media settings determine the size of images
placed in a post. WordPress allows users to select
the original size of the image or a predefined

option set up here. Change the settings to the
desired size. This makes sure that when a specific
option is selected the image will be a uniform size.

The Settings
panel
Getting to grips with the
most common settings
for your new install
In this tutorial we are going make some small
changes to the settings of our theme. So from a
fresh install, log in to the admin panel and within
the dashboard you will see the Settings Panel on
the bottom left. The Settings panel should be the
first place we come to once our initial installation
has been done because there are certain things that
need to be set up from the very start. In here we
have seven options that we can make changes to:
General, Writing, Reading, Discussion, Media, Privacy
and Permalink. However, we only really need to
make small adjustments to a few of these settings
and some are more important than others, like the
Permalink settings. So, let’s take it from the top and
make the required changes for a solid install.

"There are certain
things that need to
be set up from the
very start"

01 The General Settings

02 The Writing Settings

03 The Permalink Settings

At the top of the Settings panel you will find
the ‘General' settings option. If you click to
open that up you will see first and foremost
an option to change your site’s main title. You
will also have an option to include a tagline
here. These two options are really all you
need to change. Once you have added in your
website’s title and perhaps your tagline, you
can scroll down to the bottom and click the
Save button.

The next option down in the Settings panel is
the ‘Writing’ option. Click that to open up our
Writing panel. In here, among other things, you
have the option of changing the number of
lines you have to work in when you’re adding
a new post to your blog. By default it is set to
ten lines, but on a small screen this can seem
quite cramped. So you can, for example, set it
to 20 lines to allow yourself more space when
adding content to posts or pages.

The other options in Settings are not really
important enough to warrant an explanation
and can be left as is. But the last option, the
‘Permalink’ settings, certainly does, so let’s open
that up to take a better look. You have different
ways your posts will be shown inside the URL
and by default the top one should be selected.
However, the best ones to use here are the
second or third option as these include the ‘slug’
of your post which is good for SEO purposes.

Dashboard, you can collapse it until you need it.
To do this, hover your cursor over the title of your
module and click on the triangle that appears.

The side panel, which includes Posts, Media,
Links, Pages and Comments, works in the same
way as modules when it comes to expanding and
collapsing. You need to hover over the title of the
side panel element and use the triangle.

07 Hide the panel

08 Easy access

09 Back to dashboard

If you want more room to work with your
modules, you can choose to hide the side panel
and see its contents as small buttons. To do this,
click on the arrow found bellow the side panel
called ‘Collapse menu’.

If you want to jump straight in without using
modules on your Dashboard then you can click
on the New button at the top of your Dashboard
screen and choose Post to begin writing, or click
on one of the other options.

The Dashboard button is found on all of the
pages you will use in WordPress. If you move into
another section of WordPress, such as Comments
or Posts, you can always head back to your
Dashboard by clicking this button at any time.

Take your first steps in creating
a WordPress blog
Every good WordPress blog consists of top-quality posts. Here we show
you how to create well-worked posts with text, images and video

G

etting a WordPress blog up and
running is much simpler than you
might think. Once you've completed
the initial installation process, getting a post
online takes a matter of minutes.
The foundation of any blog is its posts,
and getting these right is paramount to a
successful, informative and compelling blog.
So ensure you have carefully considered
every detail before you get going. It is worth
noting that the styling of a blog post is
predetermined to a certain extent by the
current theme. Nevertheless, the Posts
window provides enough ammunition to
ensure your posts are well presented and
neatly styled.
First things first: the title is perhaps the
most important element of any blog post, so
make sure it's relevant and appealing. Next is
the text; again make this engaging and style
it so it’s readable. Beyond the text, images
and video are worth considering to add
colour and interest. Finally, before publishing,
it’s time to add in tags and create categories
to make your posts more
search-friendly.

01 Log in

02 The Dashboard

There are two options, first visit the URL of the blog, for example www.
myblog.co.uk/blog. If the default theme hasn’t been changed it’ll have
a Log in link under Meta. Click this and add your details. Otherwise it
can be accessed via www.myblog.co.uk/blog/wp-login.php.

In the Dashboard , users will need to pay attention to the menu on the left and
to a lesser degree At A Glance and QuickPress. The other modules Incoming
Links, Other WordPress News etc, can be hidden to free up screen space. Click
Screen Options and the check boxes of the modules you want removed.

03 At a Glance

04 The Posts menu

05 New post

The At a Glance module gives users a quick
summary of the current state of the blog. All the
elements in the Right Now module link directly
to its related counterpart. Click the title bar on a
module to expand/collapse.

To add or edit posts, the Posts menu is the place
to start. Click the Posts title bar and the menu
will expand to reveal the post options. To edit a
current post, click Edit and all the posts stored on
the database will be revealed.

The new post window is divided into two
sections, the title and the body. The first text
box in Add New Post is where the title goes.
Remember, the formatting will differ from what
you see as this is determined in the style sheet.

06 Post text

07 Simple styling

The body of the post is placed in the second text box and this will contain
all the text and images found in a single post. To add the post text, type in
the desired text like you would do in any other document. Remember to
abide by any standard grammar rules, such as paragraphs and so on.

The Visual post editor is a simple editor, it is much like using word processing
software such as Microsoft Word. Click the last icon on the toolbar, it’s called
Toolbar Toggle, to view all options. To bold the first sentence, select the text
and press B, alternatively use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+C.

08 More styling

09 Resizing text

To add more styles to the text, select the appropriate button. ‘I’ adds
the italic effect, ‘ABC’ chooses a language, ‘U’ adds an underline and
‘A’ allows users to choose a new colour for the text. Use the Align
buttons to place your text left, right or centrally.

The text in a post can’t be resized in the traditional sense. The text size is
predetermined by the theme in use. However, the Paragraph drop-down
list has a number of options, such as Paragraph, Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.
Heading 1 is the largest, 6 the smallest and Paragraph normal.

Learning how
to manage
your blog
Here we include a few more
tips and techniques you will
need to know
Getting posts on to a blog is the main priority for
many bloggers and the WordPress (2.7 onwards)
Dashboard provides a quick and easy answer.
QuickPress allows users to create and publish a
post directly from the Dashboard. This is a slimmed
down version of the standard Add New Post page
and provides all the essentials without the need to
go beyond the opening page. Users can add a title,
text, insert images, video, audio etc and add tags.
Editing and updating posts is a simple but
essential task and a visit to Edit>Posts will reveal all
the posts in a blog. Each post is assigned a number
of quick access options that only appear when the
cursor is placed over the post title. The options
on offer are Edit, Quick Edit, Delete and View. Edit
takes a user to the standard post, allowing users to
edit as normal. Remember, when you’ve finished
editing a post, hit Update Post to save any changes.
The Quick Edit option works within the Edit Posts
window and allows users to neatly and quickly
change categories, tags, title, etc. The Delete and
View options do exactly what they suggest.
Beyond editing a post there are a few additions
that we have yet to mention. Links are a key
component of a website, and WordPress is no
different. The standard toolbar includes two link
options, Insert/edit link and Unlink. To add a link
select the desired text and press the Insert link
button (top row). In Link URL add the URL to link to
(needs http:). By default, WordPress includes http://,
so if copying in a URL remember to check that
the http:// has not doubled up. Target allows the
user to choose if the link URL opens in the same
window or new window. There is the option to add
a title, and to add a class. This effectively styles the
link using a predetermined style.

10 Preview post

11 Save Draft

The post is now beginning to take shape. Click
Preview in the Publish module, this will open
another window to display the selected post.
Keep the window open and refresh when more
has been added to the post.

If the post is in good shape, save a draft by
pressing Save Draft. This will save the post and
reload the page, allowing the user to continue
adding to the post. The draft of the post can be
found via Posts>All Posts.

12 Upload an image

13 Insert options

Post text is often accompanied by an image. To
insert an image, place the cursor in the position
where the image is set to appear. Click the Add
Media icon, then Select Files, browse to the
location of the image, select it and press Open.

There are a whole host of image options. The
name of the image is used as the title, this is the
text that will be seen in the browser when the
cursor is placed on the image. Caption text will
appear directly underneath the text.

14 Image alignment

15 Image size

Before inserting an image the alignment options
need to be determined. If the Alignment option
remains as the default (None), all text will be
placed above and below the image. Left, right
and centre will wrap text around the image.

Users can choose to select an image size before
adding to a post. Full Size is the actual size of the
image. The remaining options – Thumbnail and
Medium – have their sizes predetermined by the
current theme.

Use the Quick Edit option to quickly change categories,
add tags and modify the title

The Insert/edit link window allows users to link to
internal posts or pages

16 Edit image
An image in a post is still open to editing.
Click the image and select the icon to the left
to open the Edit Image window. Here users
can choose to resize and more. Press Update to
initiate any changes.

17 Browser upload
WordPress allows users to add an image directly
from a web location. The first step is to get the
URL of the desired image. Once the URL has been
located, copy and paste into the 'Insert from URL'
field. The images will appear underneath.

18 Video options

19 Add a YouTube video

20 Read more

Place the cursor in the position where the video
is to be added. Click the Add Media button, select
the video and wait for it to upload. Click the video
to view the different options. Add a Title, Caption
or Description and click Insert into Post.

Head to YouTube (www.youtube.com) and
search for a video. Underneath the video is a
Share button, click to reveal the Embed button.
Copy the code, head back to WordPress, switch to
the HTML view and paste the code into the post.

A post will display all the text and images on the
front page of a post. To reduce the amount of
post text on the front page, the More tag can be
inserted. Place the cursor in the desired position
and press the Insert More tag button.

21 Tags

22 Categories

23 Publish

Adding tags helps identify the content of a post
and helps visitors find a specific post. To add a tag
simply enter the descriptive text in the Post Tags
text box and press Add. Repeat to add more tags.
To remove a tag click 'x' next to the tag.

Categories help define where a post can be
found. Create a new category by clicking Add
New Category, adding the title and pressing Add.
By default all new categories are selected. Choose
the relevant category or categories for the post.

Finally, the time has come to publish the post.
Check the post via the Preview button, make any
adjustments and hit Publish. The post will now
appear on the blog front page. Head back to
Posts>Add New and start populating your blog.

Edit your WordPress blog
posts with ease
Whether you are updating some information or correcting a mistake, you will always
need to edit your posts. We guide you through the various ways you can do it

W

ordPress is designed in such a
way that creating a new post for
your blog is as simple as typing
it in. You won’t, however, always get your
blog appearance or text just how you want
it on your first try. What's more, if you’ve got
a news-based site or content that's timesensitive, you might need to update a post
with new information as it becomes available.
You may even find you simply need to go
back and correct a typo.
Thankfully, this is not a challenging task.
A WordPress blog is a dynamic site where
nothing is ever fixed and final, and every word
and image can be tweaked and adjusted until
you are 100 per cent happy.
In this tutorial we will guide you through
the various ways in which you can edit your
posts, from that simple typo correction to
more advanced functions, such as batch
editing your posts to help keep your site
organised and easily searchable for your
visitors. We also detail how you can sort your
categories, so those readers who are only
interested in one topic can
easily get to what they want
to read.

01 A quick check over

02 Editing shortcut

Once you have finished composing a post and have published it on
your blog it is always good practice to go to your site and give it a
quick once over – if you haven’t got someone checking your text,
simple mistakes can be easily missed. Click View Post to preview it.

To edit your words, you need to click through to the post you have just
published. If you are still logged in to your WordPress account then you will
see a little red icon called Edit Post at the top of the post. If you click on this,
you will be taken straight through to the edit post screen.

94 Web Design for Beginners

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net

03 Begin editing

04 Post management

05 Editing options

You will be back at the editing screen where you
created the post in the first place. Use it as you
would when creating a new post from scratch
– text, images, URLs, tags and categories are all
editable too. Click ‘Update post’ when done.

For much wider editing purposes, open the
control panel and click on the Posts menu option
found over on the left-hand side of the screen.
This will now open a new screen showing every
post you have published on your site.

Hover your mouse over a post and some options
will appear, including Edit and Quick Edit. Edit is
the same as the Edit Post option from Step two,
taking you to the regular post editing screen.
Choose this option if you need to change the text.

06 Quick Edits

07 Changing the slug

If you are happy with the content of a post but still need to edit it more
for housekeeping purposes, for example to add it to a new category or
change its tags, you can simply select the Quick Edit option. The box will
now expand to give you a range of admin options.

One interesting – and useful – change you can make to a post is the slug.
This is the part of the URL that is automatically generated from the title of
your post. For ease of use, you can change this to something a little bit more
memorable than the default one.

08 Author name

09 Categories

Likewise, you might need to change the author name assigned to
the post. Even if you are the only person posting on your site, you
might want to post site announcements under ‘admin’ or similar to
keep them separate from content posted under your own name.

If you forgot to add your post to relevant categories initially then you can
do that under the Quick Edit function here. However, if you want to create
a new category you will need to either go into full editing mode or click on
the Categories option in the left-hand menu in order to create it.

Updating
RSS feeds
Keep people coming back to
your site and updated thanks
to RSS feeds
When you edit a post and click the Update button,
the changes will be instantly applied to your site, but
your avid readers will not be immediately aware of
the fact that you have changed the story. It won’t be
placed at the top of your front page, neither will your
RSS feed be updated with a new entry. Of course, if
you are only correcting a typo or tweaking an image,
this is exactly how you would want it to be, but if you
have made a significant change to one of your posts
then you need to be able to alert readers to your
changes so they can find out all the latest news on
stories available on your blog.
The way to go about this is by adjusting the date
the blog entry was posted. If you change the date
to something later than your last entry then it will
automatically move the post back up to the top of
the front page (where it will stay until you get round
to posting again). In order to update your RSS feed,
you should change the date to something in the
future. Schedule a new posting date of, say, one
minute from now, then in a minute’s time the story
will be posted again (but not duplicated) and the
RSS feed will also be updated. Users who subscribe
to your feed will see the story back in their news
reading software, and the post will be marked as
‘Updated’ in order that they know they have already
seen the post before and should be on the lookout
for changes.
A final piece of good practice is to clearly mark
the edits you make to a post so that your readers
can find them easily. This especially applies if
you have more information to add to a news
story, or are making a change based on readers’
comments. Rather than writing in the lines, add a
new paragraph at the bottom of the post, marked
Update. If necessary, you could also add the word
(updated) to the post title as well. Your readers will
be grateful for this as it’ll save them searching for the
new content.

10 Changing status

11 Make it stick

After making any of these changes, you need to
make sure you click the Update button in order
to apply them to the post. If you open another
post before doing so then your post will not be
updated. If you want to undo any changes, click
the Cancel button.

Quick Edit is extremely useful for making minor
changes to single posts, but sometimes you will
want to make similar changes to multiple posts,
for example, when you are cleaning up your
tags, to ensure consistency. Click the Posts option
to view all the posts on your blog.

12 Update your post

13 Bulk editing

To insert an image into a post first, place the
cursor in the position. Click the Add Media icon,
the first in the line next to Upload/Insert. Click
Select Files, browse to the location of the image,
select, press Open and it is uploaded.

There are options associated with an image
before it is inserted into a post. The name of the
image is used as the title; the text seen in the
browser when the cursor is placed on the image.
Caption text will appear under the text.

14 Choosing your posts

15 Getting ready to edit

There is a check box next to every post, so tick
the ones you want to edit in bulk. If some of the
posts are listed on another page you will need to
use the Search function to find them – clicking
through pages will lose your previous selections.

With your multiple posts selected, click on the
drop-down menu at the top of the window that
is marked Bulk Actions and choose Edit from the
list. Click Apply to open the bulk editing menu
options. This feature can save you a lot of time.

Updated RSS feeds will be clearly marked so your
readers can look out for changes

Mark the changes you make to your posts clearly
so your readers can find them easily

16 Removing posts
The left-hand box displays the posts you will be
editing in bulk. Each one has a small 'x' next to
it – if you decide you don’t want to apply your
changes to any specific post you can click the 'x'
at any time to remove it.

17 Adding tags
The most likely use for editing several posts at
one time will be to assign new tags to them.
Enter your choice of new tags in the box,
separating each one with a comma and space.
You cannot remove existing tags in this way.

18 Closing comments

19 Managing tags

20 Editing categories

Another good use of batch editing is for closing
comments that may appear on older posts. These
are the ones that are likely to attract spam so you
can prevent more comments by selecting the ‘Do
not allow’ option from the Comments menu.

Under Posts is the Tags option, click to open. Here
a new tag can be added by adding a tag name,
slug and description and pressing Add New Tag.
The available tags are listed to the right, hover the
cursor over a tag and press Edit.

Categories are the most important way of
keeping your site organised and its content
manageable. As with posts you can edit them in
bulk by ticking the box next to them, although in
this instance they can only be deleted.

21 Tidying your categories

22 New categories

23 Category slugs

Hover your mouse over a category in order to
see the Edit option. Click this and you can fill in
additional details about the category, for example
a description which can be shown in your blog’s
theme to give users more info.

To create a new category enter a name and click
on the Add New Category button. You can now
assign posts to this category using the Quick
Edit function explained in Step nine. Try to keep
categories to a minimum though.

Finally you can change the slugs for each
category. By default, the category URL will be
derived from the name, but if there are multiple
words in it you might want to give it a shorter,
friendlier name.

Post images into your
WordPress blog
Every blog post needs an image to illustrate it, and WordPress
provides no fewer than four methods for doing this

I

t almost goes without saying that good
images are a crucial part of any blog – yours or
anyone else’s. Even if your site is not particularly
visually oriented, you’re not running a photography
business for example, a well-chosen image
displayed on the front page of the blog is second
only to post titles in encouraging visitors to click
through to read your content.
Images can also be used to help pace the reader
by breaking up longer posts, transforming large
swathes of text into more digestible chunks. If you
want to drive traffic onto your blog and keep it
there, then you need to make it look good – text-

only pages will drive people away, and that’s the last
thing that you want to happen.
Adding images to posts is actually quite a simple
process in WordPress, but the site does give you a
number of different ways of not only adding but
also managing the images you’ve used.

“Images can also be used to help pace
longer posts by breaking up large swathes
of text into more digestible chunks”

How well-placed pictures can improve your blog dramatically

Header
A vital part in any website design,
the header is often the first

something as eye-catching as this,

Breaking it up
Dividing your text up with a few
cleverly placed pictures will increase
your site’s readability no end. Most
web users don’t want to read
endless blocks of text

98 Web Design for Beginners

In this tutorial we will take a look at each of these
techniques, giving you and insight into how to get
the most from your blog. Once you have got going
with adding visual enhancements in this way, it will
be one of the most common tasks you will – or at
least, you should be – performing on your blog.

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net

01 Position the cursor

02 Find your images

03 Uploading images

As a general rule, it’s easier to add your images
either before or after you have added your text.
All you have to do is position the cursor where
you would like your first image to go, then simply
click the Add Media button.

From the window that opens, you will see that
you have various methods for finding and adding
images to your post. Select Upload Files and then
find the image that you wish to add. You can
either drag it in or find it by clicking Select Files.

Now select an image, or images, to upload to
your site. It’s a good idea to group all your images
together into a folder before you begin. Ensure
your files are JPEG, GIF or PNGs – WordPress will
upload other formats but won’t display them.

04 Pick a name

05 Adjusting links

06 Resize the image

The caption serves as caption and alternate text
if the image is not displayed, and a relevant name
will help you find an image to reuse it later. Be
aware that some templates might have problems
displaying captions on the front page.

You have three options on what you link an image
to. Choose File URL so that when the image is
clicked the full size version is displayed separately,
or Post URL so that clicking the image displays the
full post. Click None to remove all links.

If your image is large you should resize it before
uploading to WordPress. The Medium option will
resize an image so that it is usable within most
templates. Thumbnail crops an image down to
150x150. Full size may require resizing.

07 Alignment options

08 Inserting the image

09 Manually resizing pictures

When you’ve selected the image size, you need
to choose how the image is aligned in the post.
Align Left or Right will wrap the text of your post
around the image. Your post needs to be long
enough to cover the height of the image.

In most cases you may choose None and use the
default alignment. Once you have done this, click
the Insert into Post option and the image will
now be placed at the position of your cursor in
Step one, or you can just drag it to a new position.

If you selected Full Size in Step six, your image
might now be too wide. If this is the case you can
resize it. Click on the image then grab one of the
handlebars and drag inwards to make it smaller –
the new dimensions are shown.

How to resize
your images to
fit your post
Taking the time to prepare
your images can make your
blog look more professional
When working with images on your blog, it is vital
that you consider the importance of resizing those
images as a way of enhancing both the look and
usability of your site. Dragging the image handles,
as we showed in Step nine, will change the physical
dimensions of an image as it is displayed on a
webpage, but will have no effect at all on its file size.
If your site is image-heavy, and if you are working
with photos especially, your original image files
might run into several megabytes apiece. Put a
handful into a single post and the size of the page –
and the associated bandwidth requirements – will
mount up. You might find that even with a fast
connection your site’s visitors won’t appreciate
having to load 10MB pages as a matter of course.
When resizing your images you also need to be
aware of the width of the main column in your blog
template in order that it fits in properly.
As a general rule, unless you need to provide
your site’s visitors with higher-res versions of your
images, you can resize them so that they are no
wider than that column. If you do need to provide
higher-res images then resize to around 1200-1800
pixels then use the File URL option as in Step five
and manually resize the inserted image so that it
fits into the column properly. When you do this the
image will be displayed neatly embedded in your
text, but clicking on the image will open it in a new
window, displaying the full high-res version.
Remember that high-res images can easily be
acquired and used on other sites, so if you have any
that are especially unique to you, it is a good idea to
watermark them, something you can do simply by
adding your site’s logo in the corner of the image
in Photoshop. To the same end, if you use images
found on other sites always be sure to credit them
and to link to the page where you found it.

10 Images from URLs

11 The gallery

The other options for inserting images include
‘from URL’. This requires you to enter the URL of
an image hosted on another site. You should use
externally hosted images very sparingly, since
displaying the image on your site will use the
other site’s bandwidth.

The third image option is Gallery. What this does
is show all of the images associated with the post
you are editing. If you uploaded multiple images
in Step three, they’ll all be listed here, ready for
you to edit and insert them into the post. It’s not
possible to batch edit all of your images.

12 Create an image gallery

13 The Media Library

If you want to insert a thumbnail image gallery
into your post, view the bottom half of the gallery
screen. The Gallery Settings enable you to post
an entire group of images in one go. To manually
order them you need to enter a number in the
Order column, then just click Insert Gallery.

The final option is the Media Library, where you
can access every image you have uploaded to
your site. This is where you come when you need
to reuse images already posted. So long as you’ve
given them sensible names they will be easily
searchable. Click Show to see the usual options.

Size your images to fit neatly into the main column of
your blog template

14 Editing and deleting
Linking to the file will also ensure users can view a higher
res version if they need to

If at any point you want to make changes to the way an image is displayed on your blog, simply click on
it in the edit window and then choose the Edit Image button. This will take you right back the settings
screen, where all options are fully tweakable. To remove an image, click the Delete button.

Using the
Featured
Image option
How to use the Featured Image
option for your blog posts
One of the greatest things about WordPress is the way
it takes care of things quickly and easily that would take
an experienced designer/developer a while to achieve
otherwise. It just makes things easy, and the Featured
Image option is no exception.
The basic idea behind the Featured Image function
is that many bloggers, on their homepages, want to
display an image that is associated with a post. However,
implementing this has always been a bit tricky. Previously,
users had to take advantage of custom fields, which
would allow users to specify additional information
relating to a post. In this case, that additional information
is the location of a thumbnail image.
So since the introduction of version 3.0, the user simply
uploads a single image, designates it as a featured image
and then WordPress resizes it as appropriate and places
it into the theme where desired. So, let’s take a look how
this is done.

“Since the introduction of version 3.0, the user simply uploads
a single image, designates it as a featured image and then
WordPress resizes it as appropriate and places it into the theme”
02 Once uploaded
Once you have finished uploading, a preview of
the image should appear in the pop-up dialog
box and you are free to insert the image into the
post as with any other image. WordPress should
take care of the rest, including resizing, cropping
and ensuring that the image is in the right places.

03 WordPress
year theme
changes
01 Use the Set Featured
Image link

Up until the Twenty Ten
WordPress theme, once
the post’s featured image
had been uploaded and
saved, it could be found
on the post page. But from
the Twenty Eleven theme
up to Twenty Fifteen, it
is actually added to the
header of that post.

Once logged into your dashboard, you should
see a Featured Image box on the right-hand
side of the post page. Initially it will only
include a link to “Set Featured Image”. Clicking
the link will open up the usual WordPress
image uploader where you will upload the
image as usual.

not just limited to text. WordPress includes the
facility to embed media within posts. This means
you can place images, music, videos and more in a
post to help bring your blog to life.
Don’t worry if you don’t have any content of your
own to begin with. You can embed content from
other online sources. Think of it as creating a web

content will then play from within your WordPress
blog. You can embed content from services such as
Vine, Tumblr and SoundCloud to name but a few.
In earlier versions of WordPress embedding
content was a more technical task. It used to involve
a little HTML coding to get working. The good news
is that for the most popular online services this is
no longer the case. WordPress has a white list of
services that it supports for automatic embedding.

requires just a web link. Once added to a post (as
text, not as a hyperlink) the WordPress editor will
recognise it. From here it will embed the content
into your post. Often the embedded item will carry
the look and feel of the source website and in some
cases it will even include various interactive controls.
Embedded media can add a professional touch
to a blog post with minimal effort. Just ensure it’s
used in the right way. Overloading a post with
embedded media can be messy. It can also slow
download times which could put off your audience.

Images are a quick and simple way to make a
blog post more interesting. WordPress has a
built-in menu for embedding images but there
is a simpler method. First, browse to an online
image that you wish to embed.

When pasting a URL for embedding purposes
make sure it is pasted as text only. Don’t use the
‘Insert Link’ option from the toolbar. This means

or just displaying the link itself.

Whether it’s a six second Vine video or an
extended YouTube clip, embedding a video into
your posts can help draw an audience. Much like
the previous step you can go with a simple copy
and paste approach.

08 Grab a link

Embedding a song places it into your blog
within a dedicated player helping increase
audience engagement with your posts. Two
examples of music sources are SoundCloud and
Spotify. Extracting a song from them and adding
it to your blog is a simple copy and paste job.

On SoundCloud find a track and click ‘Share’.
Copy the link and paste it into a blog post. Make
sure you leave it as text, don’t convert it into a
hyperlink. In Spotify right click on a track or an
entire playlist to access the link. Again, paste this
into a post.

09 Embed Tumblr Posts

10 Vine’s embedding options

If you have a Tumblr blog you can embed posts
into your WordPress blog. You can also embed
Tumblr posts created by others. Again, it’s a
case of copying and pasting the URL. WordPress
embeds posts with a Tumblr header and footer.

Some services offer specific embedding options.
These allow for more customisation over the
simple copy and paste approach. For example,
in Vine you can toggle video size, the window
format and the video auto-play.

By default WordPress can only embed from
websites that appear on the Whitelist. It’s possible
to work around this by installing a plug-in but
there is a risk. Content lifted from an untrusted
source could expose your set-up to malware. This
is why the Whitelist exists, to prevent accidental
embedding from malicious websites. Support for
newer services is available with each new release
of WordPress. By keeping WordPress updated you
will ensure you have the most embedding options
available. If your blog is hosted on the WordPress
servers then it is updated automatically.
Users with self-hosted WordPress blogs will
need to go through a manual update process.
WordPress will prompt you when a new update
is available. Before proceeding with this it is
important to create a backup of your database
to prevent you from losing your blog should an
error occur. There are various plug-ins available
to assist with this. Once you’ve created a backup
you’re good to go. You can either run the Update
process online or download it to run a manual
install. In our experience we have found that
running it online is both quicker and easier. Whilst
the upgrade process is running your blog will
go into maintenance mode, which means it will
not be accessible by your audience. The update
process shouldn’t last more than a few minutes.
That said, it pays to be mindful of when you’re
updating so you don’t confuse any visitors.

Maximise your embedding options by keeping
WordPress regularly updated

11 Adding HTML code

12 The [Embed] shortcode

With this approach you will need to copy the
code and paste it to the HTML section of the
post editor. Click the tab titled ‘HTML’ in the post
editor. Now paste the HTML code in the relevant
place. Click the ‘Visual’ tab once you’re done.

WordPress also has a dedicated [Embed]
shortcode. This instructs WordPress on the
allowed dimensions of an object. Place the
chosen URL within the integers ‘width’ and
‘height’ (as per our example).

looked at breaking text up into paragraphs, alignment and
so on, so now let’s move on to more exciting things like bullet
points and numbered lists. A series of bullet points is a great
way to emphasise features, functions, items and important
things. Make them short and snappy and readers can quickly
scan them to get the information they need. Numbered lists
are useful too and you don’t even need to type in the numbers
because WordPress does it for you. All you need to do is type
the first one and click the toolbar button. You can then add as
many as you need.
There are other functions that are useful too, such as the
ability to insert special characters like copyright symbols into
your text, real fractions instead of using numbers and slashes,
Greek letters, the Euro currency symbol and a whole range of
others. Inserting these is simply a point-and-click process once
you get the hang of it. All these effects will brighten up dull
looking text and make your blog more interesting.

“These effects will brighten

or twice to stop.

If you don't want to use bullet points, you might want to create a numbered
list of items instead, which is just as simple to do. Just type them on separate
lines and then select the first, click Ordered List, select the second and
repeat the process.

London-based digital performance agency, Found, takes a peek into
what the future holds for SEO, talks about designing with search
engines in mind and explains the dos and don’ts of getting a site
ranking on the search engines

The future of SEO

O

ver the past few years Google has
become increasingly effective at
targeting what it considers to be low
quality sites, reducing their prominence in the
search results and leading many to espouse the
mantra that “SEO is dead”. In truth, the idea that
“SEO is dead” has been resurfacing every few
years for over a decade and highlights nothing
more than the rapidly evolving nature of search
marketing as a whole.
Go back a couple of years and rankings
fundamentally came down to two things – the
total quantity of links from external websites and
on-page relevance, derived from incorporating
the desired target keywords. Thankfully, this is no
longer the case, with the websites in question
that attempt to manipulate search results being
actively penalised, and those adding value to the
internet rewarded.

The Importance of content
In a post Penguin and Panda world, success is
predicated on pursuing a strictly content-centric
approach when it comes to your website. Only

through content can webmasters ensure that
their websites send the correct on- and off-site
quality signals and avoid any form of penalisation.

Move to conversational search
However, changes have not been purely focused
on aspects of quality. More recently, various
updates such as Hummingbird have signified
a commitment from Google to address recent
changes in the ways that users are performing
searches. With mobile queries looking to
overtake desktops for the first time, it is critical
that search engines are capable of better
understanding their users’ intent and needs,
particularly in longer, conversational queries. For
designers this is particularly important, providing
a clear indication that Google may soon favour
mobile users over those on desktop devices. This
shift would actually signify a large change in web
design practice.
Further evidence of this change can be seen
through the recent expansion of the knowledge
graph, providing users with detailed information
on real world entities directly in their internet

EXPERT INSIGHT

“Google has
laid down the
gauntlet to web
marketers through
the introduction
of its recent
updates, stating an unequivocal
commitment to its ultimate goal
– ‘making the web a better place’.
Websites that conform to this goal
while complying with Google’s
best practices should expect to
reap the benefits over the years
to come”

UNDERSTANDING
HUMMINGBIRD
The introduction of Hummingbird in 2013
constituted the biggest overhaul of the Google
platform in over ten years. Hummingbird is
designed to enable Google to more effectively
deal with longer, conversational based searches,
such as those performed through a mobile
handset. It does this by attempting to interpret
the meaning of a whole phrase or sentence
rather than individual keywords. In a marketplace
where one third of the UK population now own a
tablet and seven tenths own a smartphone,
designers should be ensuring that the websites
they produce are responsive – Google’s preferred
type of mobile implementation.

Designing for SEO
When designing a new website, the SEO is often an after-thought,
overlooked completely or seen as an obstacle in the way of
producing a good-looking site design

E

ven with the rise in awareness about SEO
over the last few years, it is still true that
lots of great-looking websites being
created have poor SEO. However, if it is
considered early enough in the design process,
this needn’t be the case at all.
Rather than hindering SEO, good design can
actually improve the chance of ranking well. If we
consider some of the metrics that matter the
most, it’s the designer who is in control. After all, a
great-looking site is more likely to get increased
page views, have a lower bounce rate and, most
importantly, earn more links to its pages.
The earlier in the design process that you can
start thinking about SEO the better, as the early
structural decisions can make a big difference
and will be difficult to change later on. For
example, keeping your site architecture flat and, if
possible, ensuring that no page is more than
three clicks away from the home page is still very
relevant when it comes to rankings. But more
importantly, it’s also very critical to user
experience – a fundamental of good site design.
Successful web design strikes a balance between
a visually pleasing website and one that gives the
search engines what they need to rank well. After
all, why build a website if no one can find it?

Great images can hold a visitor’s attention for a
memorable experience but they may not convey
to the search engines what the site is all about,
and therefore need to be backed up by decent
content. Try to ensure that all images that feature
across key landing pages are optimised with the
relevant Alt text where possible, and consider
how much text content you have on each page.
This doesn’t all have to be in paragraph form as
headers, captions, lists and slider text all counts.
Aim for a minimum of about 200 words.
For image-heavy pages where space for text is
limited, consider using Javascript to reveal extra
text on click. It is quite a common technique for
large amounts of text to be hidden behind ‘lead
in’ text, but always ensure the fallback is to display
all of the text if Javascript is disabled.
To minimise the loading times of your pages,
you should be designing with CSS and HTML in
mind. In order to do that, you must first know the
potential of what something as sweet as CSS3
can bring to your designs. Box shadow, text
shadow, border radius, gradients, animated
transition, animated transformation, the list goes
on. It is no longer necessary to rely on images
that increase the page load time for the sake of
beauty – let the CSS and browser do the work.

The role of
web fonts
In the past it was common to see images
taking the place of the header tags
because a brand’s font was required,
forcing the web designer into making
SEO-unfriendly decisions. Designers are
now expected to create banner-like
elements of the page using HTML and
CSS with dynamic text that can be
crawled. These days sacrificing the H1,
H2, H3, H4… tags for images is the SEO
equivalent of committing design suicide.
Web fonts such as Google Fonts, Font
Deck and Typekit, among others, offer a
variety of options so there’s no excuse
not to have crawlable yet good-looking
copy. Images shouldn’t replace HTML
and CSS unless it’s a photo or logo.

Google Panda
and Penguin
Have you been hit by Panda or
Penguin? Learn which update
could be afecting your website

Are you sure your content
is up to scratch?
Creating quality content is the cornerstone of SEO success. Get this
part right, and you’re creating a solid foundation for your website
When Google crawls your site it will use a
number of indicators to assess its relevance and
then index it according to its perceived value. The
content of your website is one of the clearest
signposts for Google to work out what keywords
and phrases your website should be ranking for,
so it is crucial to get this section of your SEO
strategy right.

What does Google consider to
be good content?
Recent Google updates have indicated that thin
content pages with little or no relevant content
are not likely to be ranked as highly as websites
with more substantial, well-written content.
Blog posts, interactive animations, videos and
infographics are just some of the many ways in
which you can engage your audience and drive
traffic to your website. Written content, however,
is still one of the most important ranking factors
for Google.

Tips for producing content that
Google loves:

Engage your audience: Create content that
reads naturally, but don’t be too scared to
mention your keywords. Engage your reader by
creating original, unique content that offers real
value. For content ideas, consider what the
current questions, issues and debates are within
your niche.
Be unique: Don’t copy what other people are
doing. Write about something that your audience
will be genuinely interested in and that is unique
to your website. This is the best way to make your
website stand out.
Produce high quality content: If you are
outsourcing content cheaply, don’t expect it to
be unique or engaging for your audience.
Investing in well-written content by an expert is
always a good idea, or if you know the subject
well, why not write about it yourself?
Content needs to be accessible: Don’t hide
away key sections of your website on pages that
people can’t easily navigate to. Allow people to
easily navigate to your key content pages and
present the content in a way that will provide
real value to the user.

Write for people, not for search
engines: This has been
said many times by many
people, and that’s because
it is true. How can you

Google’s Panda and Penguin updates are
algorithms put in place to ensure users are
displayed the most relevant high quality results
when they use Google. They penalise websites
that operate against Google’s guidelines by
reducing their rankings, thus improving the
quality of search results. Depending on the level
of ofense committed, a site can potentially be
completely removed from the SERPs (search
engine results pages).
The diference between the two are the areas
they target. Penguin targets low quality links
pointing towards a site. Historically a lot of SEO
agencies have adopted quick win tactics through
purchasing links, often in bulk, to boost rankings.
This has resulted in a large number of sites
receiving penalties since Penguin’s release in 2012.
Google’s Panda algorithm targets sites that

provide low quality, scraped/duplicated and
spun content. It aims to lower the rankings of
these sites, while allowing sites with helpful, high
quality content to be seen higher up in search
results. If you suspect your site has been afected
by Penguin or Panda, there are many timelines of
Google updates online. By analysing your Google
Analytics you can mirror traffic drops to Google
updates to see if they’re due to Penguin or Panda.

WorldMags.net
Ten mistakes to avoid
Building a technically sound website is vital for any successful SEO campaign. Here are ten
of the most basic mistakes to avoid
01 No sitemap

06 Poor Metadata

A sitemap is an XML ile that feeds data to search
engines about a website’s most important pages such
as the date of the last update and the importance of a
page compared to others. All of this allows its spider to
crawl the site more intelligently and economically.
Although creating a sitemap can’t solely guarantee
search engine success, it is certainly a quick win and relatively easy to implement.

Title tags are still regarded as one of the most
signiicant inluences for on-site SEO success. This is
the irst thing the user sees on search result pages, so
it should be unique, succinct (70 characters max) and
keyword optimised according to the content subject
matter of the page. Meta descriptions are also important as they are essentially an
opportunity to entice the user to click through to the page in the form of an ad copy.

02 Failed canonical
domain check

07 Keyword stuffing

When a domain fails a canonical check, this implies
that the home page is accessible through more than
one URL. For example, webdesignermag.co.uk/
index.php, webdesignermag.co.uk/home.php and
webdesignermag.co.uk all load the home page.
Having multiple URLs load identical content is a problem because inbound link equity
can become divided and it diminishes the overall SEO site value. Some solutions to
this would be to either implement the correct canonical tags or have 301 redirects
pointing the duplicate pages to only one location.

Ensuring that a ine balance of target keywords is
incorporated into the body of a page is a challenging
feat for any copywriter. Too much and the page
appearing spammy is a risk, but too little and the
search engine may have trouble understanding what
to rank for. The solution is to use a good range of
targeted synonyms presented in a well-written structure that will engage the reader.

03 Slow loading times

Having duplicate pages within a website is a
common mistake that usually occurs on larger sites or
eCommerce sites with lots of product listings, resulting
in detrimental consequences if not handled properly.
Common instances of duplication can occur where
ilters are applied to product listings or where several minor variations of a product
exist. A solution to this is to use a canonical tag to point the duplicated pages to the
corresponding main pages – essentially having one page gaining all the SEO value.

Although broadband speeds in the UK are improving,
Google announced in 2010 that loading times are
included in their algorithm, with slow loading times
for desktops and mobiles still being a problem. Using
Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool, any page can
be analysed – identifying reasons behind and solutions for slow speeds. Common
solutions include eliminating render-blocking JavaScript and CSS above-the-fold,
leveraging browser caching, optimising images, enabling compression and minifying
JavaScript, CSS and HTML (which means removing any unnecessary spaces).

04 No header tags
Header tags such as <h1>, <h2> and <h3> give content
its structure and help the search engines understand
which parts are important. Search engines use header
tags to prioritise a page’s content, so incorrect use can
result in confusion. The solution is to ensure that the
main <h1> tag is unique and accurately incorporates the topic of the page, including
relevant keywords. Likewise, any following subheadings should use <h2> and <h3>
tags where applicable.

08 Duplicate content

09 Links from
non-credible sources
Inbound links are considered the most important ofsite factor in determining natural ranking success, with
the quality of the link source being at the forefront. The
most inluential links come from authoritative websites
within the same industry, with the linking page containing content relevant to the
target page. Although acquiring links from quality sites is challenging, one link from
an authoritative site can have a more positive efect on rankings than a few hundred
links from non-credible sources.

05 Missing Alt attribute

10 Generic internal
anchor text links

Search engines cannot understand images, so it
is imperative to attach descriptive and relevant
text in the form of an Alt attribute. This allows the
search engine to fully understand the image and
is an opportunity to add relevancy and keyword
rich descriptions to the page. One common mistake is to be too vague with the
descriptions – for example, blue trainers can be further enhanced into blue and white,
limited-edition Nike running trainers.

Anchor text is the clickable text of any link on a page.
When a website is crawled, the search engine uses this
when ascertaining the content and relevance of any
associated page. Using generic anchor text such as ‘click
here’ when linking to internal pages is a missed SEO opportunity.
The anchor text should include relevant keywords that the page wants
to rank for but over-optimising can also have a negative efect, so keep the
balance right.

Analysing analytics

U

nderstanding the metrics behind your
website is fundamental to being able to
affect how the search engines rank your
site. You can use Google Analytics to help inform
you on how your current website content is
performing and where your website’s traffic is
coming from. It can also be used to help you
define the next thing you should be improving or
adding to your site.
A page with a high bounce rate equates to low
interest from a user perspective and is going to
harm your rankings in the long term. Now this
could be down to poor content on your page,
but equally it could be down to the low relevance
of a site linking to your content. If they came
looking for skateboards and all you have is
cupcakes, they’re likely to leave pretty quickly.
Ensuring links point to the page on your site
most relevant to the content they are linking from
is a good way to reduce bounce rate and increase
user interaction on a site. Backlinks are a key
ranking factor in Google’s algorithm, and

116 Web Design for Beginners

Unlock the full potential of GA by going
beyond tracking web stats. GA allows you
to set up goals and events to measure how
well you meet your objectives.
Set up goals to track discrete actions
such as form fills and transactions or
set up events to measure interactions
that are independent of a page
load – such as video plays or
document downloads.

“Backlinks are a key ranking factor
in Google’s ranking algorithm, and
although the level of their importance
has decreased slightly over recent years,
evaluating them is a key part of SEO”
although the level of their importance has
decreased slightly, evaluating them is a key part
of SEO. Tools like MajesticSEO, Ahrefs and Web
Master Tools allow you to assess your backlink
profile, showing which sites link to you, what
pages contain the most linking domains and a
number of other useful metrics.
When combined with organic traffic data in GA
(Google Analytics), you can get an insight into
how those links are affecting your pages and
their rankings. Having high quality relevant sites

linking to yours is absolutely crucial and you are
very likely to see an increase in traffic and
positions, but perhaps a more significant metric
for rankings than volume of traffic is traffic
quality. Quality of backlinks rather than quantity is
key here.
Pointing links towards pages purely to pass on
link value can result in a penalty via the Penguin
algorithm and should not be attempted. A good
backlink is usually an earned, relevant and a
logical link from one site to another.

WorldMags.net

WorldMags.net
Improving your results
Sessions
The best way to improve organic sessions is via
rankings. If your site appears first in the SERPs,
there is a likely CTR (click through rate) of around
33%. The importance of rankings is shown by
analysing the CTR of a result in tenth position,
which averages about 2%.
There are many ways to increase a website’s
ranking for any individual term. The most
common – and arguably most effective –
method is creating content and getting links
with that search term in mind.
Page load speed
Page load times are now a significant factor in
Google’s ranking algorithm. Use free tools like
Google PageSpeed to identify where you need
to spend the time.
Once you have identified the pages with the
problems and which elements need attention,
you should know what to do. Minifying the CSS
and Javascript can reduce file size dramatically
and you’ll be amazed what can be saved by
optimising and compressing images.
Bounce rate
Bounce rate shows the percentage of users
who view one page on your site before leaving.
Having a high bounce rate is a big issue as it
shows low levels of user engagement and is one
of the signs of a low quality site.

Reducing the bounce rate of users visiting
your site can be a daunting task but to overcome
it there are simple steps you can take to get
started. Firstly, increase the quality of the content
on your landing pages. Is it informative enough?
Is it interesting enough? Secondly, interlink your
pages to other relevant areas of the site. By doing
this, you’ll allow easy user navigation throughout
the site and site visitors will be more likely to visit
multiple pages.
Conversions
Conversions are goals defined by the website
owner. The webmaster commands GA to track
certain user interactions with the site; this can
be anything from landing on a product page, to
filling out a contact form, to registering as a user.
CRO (conversion rate optimisation) is the practice
of increasing conversions not by maximising
the number of users but by increasing the rate
at which current users convert. Would more
people complete a form on your site if the
button said Enquire rather than Submit? Without
testing these things you won’t know, but luckily
GA contains its own page testing tool called
Experiments. Experiments allows you to divide
traffic to variations of a page to see how those
different variations affect conversion. Set up tests
on key pages to understand what page elements
most affect user behaviour. This knowledge can
be of vital importance.

SEO is incredibly important for building a high-traffic website

S

EO (search engine optimisation) is not
a feature that you may be aware of
when first setting up a new website, but
understanding how it works can make the
biggest difference of all to ensuring that you
drive as much traffic to your site as possible.
The quality of your website’s content must
always be paramount, of course; but no matter
how good the quality, you still need to make
sure that your website stands out and competes
against the millions of other sites that are also

118 Web Design for Beginners

trying to attract the same visitors. There is no
guaranteed way to ensure lots of traffic, but to
not make use of SEO techniques is probably to
ensure that your new site takes a long time to get
off the ground, with the possibility that it will never
gain more than a handful of visitors.

The consideration of how internet search engines
work and what people are looking for will ensure
that you are targeting your content to the right
people at the right time and give you a better
chance of making your site a success within a
relatively short time period.

“Ensure that you are targeting your content
to the right people at the right time”

01 Encourage interaction

02 Google Webmaster Tools

03 Know the trends

If you allow readers to comment on your content,
they are likely to add info that search engines will
pick up on. This means your readership is doing
some of the work for you and increasing the
amount of information that search engines will
list. It is also ideal for encouraging repeat visits.

Sign up for Google Webmaster Tools. Google
provides a great deal of information on how to
use keywords correctly and how to potentially
increase the number of web searches that end up
at your website. Google is still the biggest search
engine – ignore it at your peril!

Since they change so quickly, it makes sense to
know what the trending topics of the moment
are. Keep an eye on www.google.com/trends,
which shows the top searches in real-time. If
you can tap into these topics, provided they’re
relevant to your site, you may increase traffic.

04 Avoid the bloat

05 Meta tags

06 Keywords

As you get more experienced with your website,
try to cut down the code as much as possible.
You are at the mercy of search engines and
unnecessary code will only get in the way.
Keeping everything trim will also speed up the
site for your visitors and the search engine robots,
so everyone’s a winner.

Your website should have a meta description
at the top of the page. This is not visible to the
reader, but does tell search engines what the site
is about and is also displayed in search engine
results. Written effectively, it will entice people
who receive results from your site to visit above
the other results that are returned.

Although no longer the key way to generate
search engine traffic, keywords (including
synonyms) still indicate to search engines what
your website is about. More and more, though,
the emphasis is on well-written, user-centric
content that is updated regularly: avoid keyword
stuffing at all costs.

07 Title tags

08 Try to be unique

09 Avoid duplication

Keywords should be used in title tags as they are
the overall label for the page's content. This helps
search engines sift through sites by relevance
and helps searchers identify if it is what they're
looking for. Make keywords relevant to each
specific page rather than the site in general.

Simply copying headlines and content from other
sites is not a good idea. It not only shows a lack
of originality, but also means that you will receive
very low search ratings for that content. Search
engines rate unique content above everything
else, so try to be original as often as possible.

You also need to be careful to avoid repeating
phrases or content on your own site. This can trick
search engines into believing that the content
is not justified and you will rank lower through
penalisation. It is good practice anyway to not
duplicate your own content on any site.

10 Be search engine friendly

11 The website structure

12 Build links

Most CMSs offer a choice of how URLs for each
page will be displayed. Try to use the ‘search
engine friendly’ format, which uses the title tag
of the page in the URL, eg ‘/www.domain.com/
article-title’. This also makes it look much cleaner
and more professional to the reader.

There are tricks to how content should be
displayed on any website and there are some
rules that are worth following. It has been proved
that people tend to read in an ‘F’-shaped format,
so try to keep as much of your important content
near the top and in a left-hand bar as is feasible.

One very important factor in increasing your
traffic rank is to build links with other sites. The
better quality incoming links you have, the better,
improving your page rank with Alexa, Google,
etc. Links build your reputation as well as your
traffic – and you need both for success.

13 Automated SEO plug-ins

14 The hard work

15 Stop words

If you use a CMS like WordPress, there are
many plug-ins available to automate much of
the process of improving SEO. If you have little
knowledge of how SEO works, you should try one
and then start working out your own solutions as
your knowledge increases.

You can build links to your site by increasing
your activity and shareability on social networks.
Having a commenting facility will also boost
interaction to keep your page regularly updated
without the hard work. Although it may take a
while to establish, it'll be worthwhile in the end.

If you have your URLs presented using the titles of
each article, you need to be aware of stop words.
Search engines ignore commonly used words
such as ‘I’, ‘the’ and others, so using them can
confuse the searches. There are plug-ins available
that will automatically remove these for you.

16 Paying for help

17 Don’t buy traffic

18 Don’t obsess

A simple search for ‘SEO’ on the web will bring
back many companies offering to improve the
SEO on your site. You should research these
carefully before you decide to pay for help, but
they can at the very least offer advice. Do bare in
mind though, that no one knows your product or
service like you, so give it a try yourself first!

There are many services available that offer the
chance to buy links and other mechanisms that
claim to improve your traffic. Google's algorithm
is now sophisticated enough that it will be able
to identify when links are bad quality. This could
undo all of your hard work in a matter of days.
Remember, it is quality not quantity.

The main thing with SEO is to understand the
tricks you need, but to not obsess over them.
Most of your time should be spent creating a web
experience that brings readers back repeatedly,
and the SEO side should be seen as topping up
your core audience. For businesses, SEO is much
more important to gain new customers.

Judging SEO success It’s not easy to judge how effective your SEO strategy is
We said in the final step of this tutorial that SEO should not be obsessed about, and
that the content is the most important factor, but you still need to understand how
your statistics show your success. We can break down your visitors into two broad
categories: those who repeatedly visit your site and those who have recently visited.
In general terms, you can analyse how many are from each group by checking your
stats and seeing who has come direct to the site, who has been referred by another
site and which readers have come via search engines. The direct visitors are likely

the loyalists who enjoy your content, while the one-time or referrals have most likely
come from searching for specific information. To add complexity, even your loyal
readers will have likely come via search in the first place so they could still represent
a good example of SEO working effectively for you. The best advice is to keep an eye
on your stats and to check for shifts in the numbers. Ideally, you want a loyal base
of readers who may spread the word, but with a healthy number of new readers
continually dripping through.

SET YOUR GOALS
When you irst build a new website,
it is a good idea to have objectives
in mind for where you want the
site to go and how popular you are
expecting it to become. Google
Analytics includes a Goals feature,
which lets you set up targets for your
site in a number of areas. For example,
you can choose to have a goal for
the average duration of visits to be
60 seconds if they are low now, and a
separate goal for the number of daily
visitors. This gives you something to
aim for and the Analytics service will
automatically check your stats to see
if you have reached your targets.
Once you have set up your goals,
you can view your progress in the
front graphs which show your goal
conversion rate and the number that
you have completed. Every business
and its associated websites needs to
have targets; the services ofered by
Analytics are quite simplistic, but they
give you something to aim for and
can greatly enhance your site if you
put the efort in to reach the goals
you have set for yourself. They are
one of the most important parts of
Google Analytics.

02 Sign up

Go to www.google.com/analytics. If you don’t already have a Google
account, click Create Account. Tap Sign up and enter the required details – try
to make the password as secure as possible. Then click Create my account.

Now you have a Google account, you’ll be asked to sign up to Google
Analytics. Tap the Sign up button and proceed to the next page. You now
need to input your website URL and choose an account name.

03 Starting the setup

04 Time to jump

On the next page, scroll down to the ‘What are you tracking?’ section and
choose the correct option for your website setup. Most people will require
the ‘Single domain’ option, but choose ‘Multiple subdomains’ if applicable.

Now to ind out how to insert the Analytics code for your site setup. Each

whether it is WordPress, Squarespace or another web publishing platform.

When you come back, you should see a series of graphs showing the traffic

over time, but you will need to spend some time looking at the graphs.

Click Visits at the top of the box and a new page will pop up. The graph at the
top shows the number of daily visitors and the boxes below delve deeper
into the operating systems used and geographical locations of your readers.

09 Study the data

10 Check the screens

It makes sense to check the Browser stats irst, showing which browsers
visitors are using. You should ensure that your site presents correctly in each,
putting emphasis on the most popular browsers within your readership.

As well as the OS, check the screen resolutions used by visitors. If low ones are
at the top, you’ll need to ensure your site works on mobile devices. Either let it
scale down or use a plug-in to change it to a mobile version automatically.

11 Build interest

12 Delving deeper

The ‘Avg. Visit Duration’ box details how long visitors stay on your site. Very
short visits are classed as ‘bounced’ and can be ignored. The longer the
average, the more interesting your content is to the readers – a good sign!

Standard Reporting>Traffic Sources shows the keywords searched for to get
to your site. It also shows how much traffic is direct to the site and how much
comes from search engines – ideally, you’ll want to see the latter grow.

'Social' shows traffic from social networks, which will help you analyse how
efectively you’re using Facebook, Twitter, etc. It’s not too hard to make these
stats grow to form a decent percentage of your traffic.

see if your money is being well spent or if you need to change your methods.
Well-targeted ads can make a huge diference to incoming traffic numbers.

18 Export your data

‘Custom Reporting’ lets you build reports tailored to your goals and the way
your site is set up. You can create reports that cover all of your speciic needs
and this could potentially greatly speed up your traffic analysis in the future.

Use the Export option at the top to export your data in PDF format. This can
be useful to share with potential advertisers or for data analysis – you can
send it to specialists for advice on the best methods to grow your site.

Create a Google Sitemap
for easier searching
A

A Google Sitemap will make a huge
diference to your site’s recognition
Google Sitemap is important for a variety of reasons.
Firstly, it tells Google how your site is structured and
ensures that the search provider is aware of every page
present on your site. This provides for new sites with lots of
varied content, making sure they are properly structured in the
Google mechanism, not to mention the site itself. As a result,
the chances of search results coming your way are much more
favourable. In fact, a sitemap is more important for new sites
because Google is less likely to be aware of the extent of your
website's content if you are yet to establish external links from
other sites; this can spell a long road ahead towards gaining
recognition from the biggest search provider of all.
A sitemap ofers a shortcut to Google recognition. While it
ofers no guarantee of success, the process of uploading one is
quick and simple, so you have nothing to lose by following the
steps here. Once you have completed the process, you should
be able to leave it as is, although it can be beneicial to update
it from time-to-time. The most important factor, however, is to
ensure that you have uploaded one initially. Anything you can
do to make Google more aware of your site can only be a very
good thing.

“A Sitemap offers a shortcut

NOT JUST GOOGLE
You can submit sitemaps and other
site-related data to other search
engines as well. For example, there are
webmaster tools available for Bing at

and these work in a very similar way
to the Google process. If you have the
time, try to submit sitemaps to all of
the large search engines to increase
your visibility to everyone.

03 Upload the Sitemap

04 Submit your Sitemap

You now need to upload the sitemap ile to your root folder via FTP. Simply
upload it and check that it is visible by navigating to
<your domain>/sitemap.xml. You should see the ile displayed and if
present, you can move to Step 4.

You now need to go to Site Coniguration at Google Webmaster Tools and
choose Add/Test Sitemap. Simply enter the URL of your sitemap and submit
it. Google will then analyse the ile and index your site accordingly. It’s a
painless operation.

War has long been waged over
designing in Photoshop versus
designing in the browser. But, maybe
it’s time we all just got along

W

ith the development of HTML5 and CSS3,
‘designing in the browser’ has become common
practice. Photoshop has taken a back seat for most
web designers, as better standards and new technologies
have allowed for more creative freedom when working with
code. With the ability to create gradients, round corners, drop
shadows and more with ease in CSS, it sometimes feels like
Photoshop’s bloated feature set is steadily becoming obsolete.
However, a new movement has started, bringing Photoshop
back into the web design fold and repurposing its powerful
tools for brainstorming sketching and wireframing.
Many designers have criticised designing in the browser for
what Andy Budd (CEO at Clearleft) described as, a lack of “even
the most rudimentary tools, like the ability to draw lines or
irregular objects through direct manipulation”. The argument
here is, although HTML and CSS are capable of rendering
designed elements without the use of Photoshop, the lack
of freedom to directly manipulate designs can be risky for
creativity. Instead we should be using Photoshop to create
mood boards and sketches at the start of the design process,
allowing creative ideas to flow and develop without the
abstraction of a text editor and strict standards to stunt them.
This year, Photoshop is 25 years old and, with the release
of CC 2015, now in its 22nd iteration. Over that time, Adobe’s
software has seen radical changes, developing from an
image-editing application into a powerful design tool, with a
huge and dedicated user base. With competitors – including
Adobe’s own Illustrator and Bohemian Coding’s Sketch,
popping up – Photoshop has had to battle to stay relevant.
This has lead to a repositioning of Photoshop. It’s no longer
the tool used to create polished, inished site designs to be
sliced and rebuilt on the web. Instead, it’s found a place as a
prototyping tool, allowing designers to present clients with
ideas, palettes, styles and wireframes that can be easily edited
and don’t involve hours of development time.
In response, Adobe and third-party developers have
been building tools to bridge the gap between Photoshop
and CSS, making the transition from prototype to product
smoother. Here, we’ll take a look at some of the tools, plugins
and features that make Photoshop the perfect application for
getting your ideas down, before you even open a text editor.

Sketching in Photoshop
Designing in the browser can make it hard to quickly move
elements around and try out new ideas. If you’re struggling
with this, why not turn to Photoshop? You can use familiar
tools to mock up simple, visual layouts to explore ideas and
see if they work. These don’t have to look perfect and can be
made up of simple shapes – the idea is to just get a feel for
what works and what doesn’t.
Photoshop’s Vector Smart Objects are perfect for creating
simple layouts to explore site designs. Once you’ve created
something you’re happy with, you can try it in browser and
build out the details. This approach utilises the best of both
worlds, using Photoshop to experiment fluidly with designs
and HTML and CSS to implement the inal product. This
method is especially useful if you’re having trouble with where
elements should go in responsive layouts – it also avoids
getting stuck staring at code, when a little bit of creative
freedom could give you the answer.

Sketching ideas in Photoshop has many
advantages over starting your concepts
in HTML and CSS. There is more room
for creative freedom and quick changes

more problems than it solves and is best
avoided due to the sheer amount of
time it can take. Rather, Photoshop is the
perfect tool for creating visual concepts
that aren’t conined by the CSS, helping
to avoid the initial stumbling blocks of
building the site in the browser.

A combination of any of these prototyping

remember is that you’re repositioning Photoshop
in the design process, using it as a tool for
creating a dialogue between you and the client
or a collaborator – not for pushing out inished
pages. It can still be used for creating assets to
be implemented in inished designs but in a
responsive world, static page mockups just don’t
cut it any more.

Style Tiles are the invention of Samantha Warren,

From PS to CSS
O

nce you’ve inished with all of the
prototyping stages, it’s time to take your
designs to the browser. But what’s the
best way to go about translating from Photoshop
to CSS?
Once you’ve done your sketches, created your
Style Tiles and developed your element collages,
it’s time to take the visual elements you have
established and translate them to web. In the past
this was a diicult enough operation. You would
create a huge bitmap in Photoshop, slice it up
and reassemble it online. It could be painstaking
and things often didn’t turn out as planned. Then
came CSS3 and implementing Photoshop style
efects in the browser, without the use of images,
became a reality.
That being said, it can still be diicult to get the
exact look you had achieved in PS sometimes,
when you’re working with a whole diferent set
of tools and variables in a text editor. It can be
very time-consuming translating layer styles

in PhotoShop into CSS, which is just another
reason why lots of designers started avoiding the
Photoshop step completely.
These days though, there’s a whole host of
tools and plugins available to help you translate
your ideas from canvas to browser as smoothly
as possible. Some, that we’ll look at in a moment,
directly convert your layer styles to CSS, while
others simply aid in the transition. Layerstyles.
org, for example, is a totally web-based version
of Photoshop’s layer styles dialogue that lets you
mock up the style you want and then export the
result as CSS.

The in-house method
As of version 13.1 (CS6 and above), Adobe has
included a CSS export feature right inside the
Photoshop package. Just select the layer that you
want the CSS properties for, click on ‘Layer’ in
the menu bar and hit ‘Copy CSS’. Photoshop will
output a nice chunk of code and copy it straight to

your clipboard. When you paste it into your editor
with a little bit of HTML, you’ll have a button like
the one you designed in app.
Unfortunately, this is a far from perfect solution;
the home brewed tool just isn’t up to scratch and
neglects to use RGBa values for low opacity –
and sometimes ignores efects altogether. It also
provides no formatting options before copying,
so everything has to be ixed later in the editor.
Nevertheless, even with these bugs, it does
provide you with a great base to start working
from, without having to manually input all of the
basics yourself.

Third-party CSS plugins
Photoshop’s own CSS export function works well – but it isn’t the dream solution we’ve all been
waiting for. With a few kinks left to iron out it’s up to the third-party plugins to ofer a neat and
efficient way to get our styles from canvas to browser

CSS3Ps

CSS HAT

css3ps.com
CSS3Ps is a totally free Photoshop plugin that’s been around since long
before the built-in PS to CSS3 functionality. With the extension installed, the
functionality all sits inside a neat little window. All you have to do is select a
layer group and then click the CSS3Ps logo to start the process.
Due to the nature of the software being free, you’re forced to wait 20
seconds and look at an ad, but that’s a small price to pay for such great
functionality. CSS3Ps takes you to a page with your code, ready to copy and
paste. Something to note is that this plugin ignores positioning, so you’ll need
to ix that later.

csshat.com
Unlike CSS3Ps, CSS Hat will set you back $30. Still, for the additional features
and lack of ads, the price is worth it. CSS Hat has the ability to export in
multiple formats, including LESS, SASS and SCSS. You can also toggle a variety
of other features, like comment explanations, browser preixes, whether the
code gets wrapped in a rule named after the layer and layer dimensions.
Exporting with CSS Hat isn’t quite as simple as CSS3Ps, as it doesn’t support
layer groups. This means you’ll have to export each layer separately. Other
than that, the process is simple and intuitive and the versatility of this plugin is
a huge advantage.

Working with type
T

ypography has always been something of a
problem for Photoshop. Font rendering has
never been the software’s strong suit and this
can become a problem when you’re designing for
the web.
There’s more and more emphasis, these days,
on typography for the web. With print designers
moving into the digital world en masse, a new
importance has been placed on type and fonts in
web design. Photoshop has always struggled with
rendering fonts and its Type tool is clunky and
leaves much to be desired.
The biggest problem is that, with new webfont-only subscriptions, you can’t see what the
fonts will look like when you’re mocking up
designs in Photoshop. There’s nothing worse
than getting a design to the web and realising
your chosen font clashes horribly with the design.
Web Font Plug-in from Extensis goes a long way
in solving this issue, by allowing designers to use
Google Fonts in their PSDs.

With Typekit’s desktop functionality, you can use the exact
same fonts in your mockups as you’ll be using in your final
page designs online

If you’re a CC user you will also have access to
Typekit, Adobe’s own take on the web font library.
With Typekit you can download a set number of
fonts through CC to be used with your apps. This
means you can access your Typekit fonts with
ease, since they sit in Photoshop’s font window –
so you are able to test out irm favourites such as
Proxima Nova and Bree in your static designs.

01 Do your research

02 Sketch and scan

03 New CS6 Pen Shape tool

It really is worthwhile doing your research and
getting some real-world reference material. You
can go to the library and get a book of interior
design, visit your local wallpaper shop, or take
the easy option and use a search engine to find
images of the motif you have in mind.

Sketch out your design elements on a sheet
of paper. Scan it to your computer, opening
your image file in Photoshop. If you’d like to
incorporate elements from two sketches into one
final design, that’s also fine: identify which part
you want to start drawing first and zoom in close.

We’ll use the Pen tool set to Shapes to create
an outline in CS6. The new Stroke Shape Tool
Options are an ideal replacement for paths. Set
stroke width to 1px then click to create and click
again further along the same edge to create
another. A straight line is drawn between points.

04 Create curves lines

05 Finish paths

06 Fill each path

To create a curved line, hold the mouse button
after clicking, then drag to either side. Work your
way around the motif, adding points, until you
can click on the original point. Now we want to
move on and fill our selection.

We made a total of ten paths, setting Stroke to no
colour, Fill to black – one for each of the top and
bottom petals, three for the central bands, and
one for the central flourish. Now we have to start
filling in our Path Shapes.

Filling your Paths is super-easy with the new
Shape Tool Options. All you need to do is activate
your Path Shape layer and set Stroke to No
Colour. Activate the Fill options and set colour to
black, making your Path Shape solid.

07 Use Custom shapes

08 Add layer styles

09 Merge and collaborate

As always, Photoshop provides you with even fast
ways to create shapes. Press U and select Custom
Shapes from the Tool Bar menu. You’ll find a
Fleur-de-lys shape preset in the default options.
You can combine this with other preset shape
options to create your own design.

Choose a layer and select Layer>Layer
Style>Gradient Overlay. Choose Copper. Tick the
boxes for Bevel & Emboss and Texture, then play
with the settings. Right-click on the layer in the
Layers panel and choose Copy Layer Style. Rightclick and paste the layer style onto each layer.

Turn off any background layers, then select
Merge Visible from the Layer panel pop-out
menu. Using the Burn tool, burn shadows across
the motif for a lightly distressed look. Add a Hue/
Saturation adjustment layer and reduce the
copper to silver by de-saturating the image.

10 Lay out the pattern

11 Add texture

12 Add extra distress

Reduce the size of your design accordingly, then
make a selection of it and choose Image>Define
Pattern. Now File>New and set a canvas size
that’s 1800px square. Press Shift+F5 and set Use
to Patterns, setting custom pattern with your
shape. Set Script to Brick Fill and click OK.

Desaturate your pattern. Set a blue foreground,
darker blue background. Activate the background
layer. Select Filter>Render>Clouds. Duplicate
and place at the top of the layer. Set blending
mode to Exclusion. Put a copy at the top;
Filter>Render>Fibers, blending mode Overlay.

Download a free concrete texture from www.
bittbox.com/freebies/free-texture-tuesdayconcrete/ and add it to your image. Set it to
blend using Darker Color and reduce the opacity
to 20% so that there’s some general additional
distress to your image.

15 Save for the web
13 Create an offset

14 Offset, tweak and save

Merge all visible layers into a single one, then
choose Filter>Other>Offset. Enter values of
900px for both Horizontal and Vertical; this is half
the canvas size. You’ll probably see a slight seam
across the middle of your image. Use the Clone
Stamp tool to blur this seam.

Your image will now tile perfectly. Add a Curves
Adjustment layer and Hue/Saturation Adjustment
layer to increase contrast and recolour the
artwork if desired, to suit your website. Save your
document as a PSD file to ensure you retain the
original source material for later reuse!

We’ll use Photoshop’s ‘Save for Web and Devices’
function to output a web-ready version of our
artwork. Choose File>Save for Web & Devices
and select Medium JPG – it’ll work well for the
subtlety of texture we’ve created. Save the image
with a name with no spaces, eg ‘background.jpg’.

18 Other properties

16 Use your image

17 Import your image

Once you’ve successfully saved your image, it’s
time to use it on your website. To do this you’ll
need to have a webpage lined up and ready to
go, with a CSS stylesheet and an element you’re
going to apply your repeating background to.
If you haven’t already got these in place, come
back to this section later on!

Adding a background image to your website
using CSS is very simple. First you define the
element you’d like to create the CSS rule for –
this is achieved by naming the element either
through its tag name, class or ID. Next, add a rule
for background-image and specify the image
you’d like to use as a background.

Your image will need to be in the same folder as
your style sheet. You can set the position of your
repeating image using the background-position
property, how it repeats using backgroundrepeat, and a fallback colour to be used using
background-color.

Repeating
background images
See how we constructed our
repeating background image

Add grunge

Curver for content

We’ve used a concrete texture to add
extra grunge and character to our
background tile. This is the antithesis of
the modern, clean web look, but it’s often
good to go your own way and avoid
following fashions on the web – especially
if you want your site to stand out!

We’ve used a curve adjustment to increase
the contrast of our design. Our curve has
an S shape which darkens the dark pixels
and lightens the light pixels to create more
dynamics in our image

Adjust hue and saturation
Save as a JPEG
Because our image has lots of colours and fine
textures, a JPEG file is the best format to use for
this particular background tile. We’ve created
quite a large tile, but you could have used just two
motifs arranged diagonally to get a similar effect

The colours have been adjusted before we saved
our image using a Hue/Saturation adjustment
layer. This allows us to control the overall colour
balance without having to manually alter each
layer individually, and allows for experimentation!

Repeating backgrounds The background tile is a great web design tool
Because you never quite know in advance how long a typical webpage may be, it’s
often very useful to be able to create a background that is capable of scaling to fill
the space, no matter how big or small that space is. This is why repeating background
tiles are such a mainstay of web design – they can be quite small but cover a large
area of screen without the need to create a different version of your background for
each page. The offset filter in Photoshop makes it easy to check that your image tiles
perfectly, and correct any issues if it doesn’t. When trying to decide on a background

to incorporate into your website design, it’s worth having a look at what other
websites are doing. A combination of a partially transparent image (saved as a
PNG file for variable transparency) and a background colour set to use a CSS3
gradient can give the impression of an image that’s much bigger than it really is.
CSS3 also allows you to apply more than one background image per element,
opening up a whole series of possibilities that didn’t even exist until quite recently.
Don't be afraid to experiment till you find something that works best for you.

03 Organise your layers

Create a new Photoshop document. If you have

if not, choose a document size of 1280x1024px at

a document with a background layer, doubleclick on this to convert it to a normal layer.

We need to create a base colour to work over. In
this tutorial we’re creating a graphic that includes
planets and stars, so it makes sense to choose a
dark background base colour. Double-click on the

on a PC, Option+Backspace on a Mac). Let’s name
our layers appropriately. Click twice on the name
of the layer you’ve just filled, then type ‘Page
Background’ over the existing name.

04 Add the content area

05 Align your content

06 Create a glow

Select the Rectangular Marquee tool and change
the style to ‘fixed size’. Enter a width of 720px and
a height of 900px. Click once near the bottom
of the document to create a selection. On a new
layer, fill this selection with white.

We want our content area to be centred. Select
both layers by clicking on one, then Shift-clicking
on the other, then use Layer>Align>Horizontal
Centers. This will position your 720px content
area perfectly in the centre of the design.

Duplicate the content layer and select Layer>
Layer Style>Outer Glow. Set the colour to white,
spread 8% and size 13px. Click OK, make the
other content layer invisible and set Fill to 0% for
this layer. This should leave only the glow visible.

07 Create a planet

08 Add shading

09 Merge and blur

Create a new layer, 'Big Planet’. Select an orange
for the foreground colour, dark red for the
background. Using the Circular Marquee tool
with Shift held down, draw a big circle then
Filter>Render>Clouds. (Hold Alt/Option when
selecting this to get a higher-contrast result).

The planet needs shading. With the selection still
active (if you lost your selection just Ctrl/Cmdclick on the planet layer), create a new layer and
use the Gradient tool to fill the selection with a
radial gradient from orange to black. Set the layer
to use Multiply as the blending mode.

Select the planet layer and the shading layer,
then, using the fly-out menu at the top right
corner of the Layers panel, select 'Merge layers'
to convert these two layers into one. Add a small
blur: Filter>Blur>Gaussian Blur. Enter a value of
1.3px and click OK.

Using
Photoshop’s
brush engine
Using brushes in Photoshop,
you can achieve a wide
variety of effects
Photoshop comes with a variety of brushes
built in. Selecting the Brush tool opens up a
range of options in the toolbar, allowing you to
choose style, size and hardness. You might be
forgiven for thinking that this is the beginning
and end of brushes in Photoshop, but there’s
so much more.
For starters, the set of brushes that appears
by default is only one of many sets Adobe
thoughtfully provides. To load other brush
sets, click on the flyout menu when selecting a
brush style. You’ll see a whole bunch of brush
sets just waiting for you to activate. Choose
one you like the sound of and Photoshop will
ask you if you’d like to append or replace the
current brush set. Appending simply adds the
new brushes you’re loading to the existing set.
If you’d rather keep it clean, replace the set and
you’ll just have the set you last loaded.
In addition, you can download and load in
whole new brush sets from the web. A quick
internet search for ‘free Photoshop brushes’
yields thousands of results. Every kind of brush
you can imagine can be found, ranging from
simple shapes to entire illustrations in a brush.
To install, simply download the brush set of
your choice, then click Load Brushes from the
Brush flyout menu.

10 Give it a glow

11 Copy and recolour

It would be nice to have a light-distorting
atmosphere on the planet, so let’s add another
outer glow to simulate this. Select Layer>Layer
Style>Outer Glow. Choose a bright cyan as the
colour, and set the blending mode to Colour
Dodge. Play with the other settings to suit.

Let’s quickly create a second, smaller planet.
Make sure you have the planet layer selected,
then select Layer>Duplicate Layer. Select Edit>
Transform>Scale and reduce the size. Finally,
choose Image>Adjustments>Hue/Saturation and
tick Colorize. Play with the settings to find a nice
result that suits.

12 Create a rainbow

13 Bring the rainbow into
your scene

Create a new document at 1024x1024px, 72dpi
and transparent. Select the Gradient tool and,
from the tool presets, choose Transparent
Rainbow. Draw a linear gradient top to bottom,
covering the middle third of the canvas. Select
Filter>Distort>Polar Coordinates. Ensure
‘Rectangular to polar’ is selected and click OK.

In the rainbow file, select Edit>Copy Merged
(shortcut: Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+C), then return to the
main document. Select Edit>Paste (shortcut: Ctrl/
Cmd+V). Add a layer mask to the rainbow layer,
and draw a black to white gradient onto the mask
to hide the left-hand side of the rainbow. Position
the layer to the right of the canvas.

14 Add a lens flare

15 Add stars to the space

We’ll simulate a bright sun appearing behind
the planet. Duplicate the Page Background layer.
With the duplicate selected, Filter>Render>Lens
Flare. Click on top left of filter preview window to
set flare position, then click OK. You can use the
Eraser tool to remove unwanted bits of flare.

Add stars to a new layer. Select a foreground
colour of white. Using the Gradient tool set to
use a radial foreground-to-transparent gradient,
draw small overlapping gradients covering the
top third of the canvas. You can always add more
later, so don’t overdo your gradients.

Creating our custom
header design
After creating basic planets, we use
various effects and techniques for
the design

Shooting stars
The shooting stars effect is achieved
using a stroked path with simulated
pressure. The brush is set to use a scatter
effect so that the individual elements
look like a meteor or comet trail. We’ve
added an outer glow layer style to
complete the look

Rainbow a go-go
The rainbow effect is created using
a simple gradient and the polar
co-ordinated filter inside Photoshop.
This, when combined with the
stars, planets and tentacles, helps to
create a coherent whole design

Planets
The planets were
created using
nothing more
sophisticated than
the Cloud filter and
a circular selection.
Shading helps to
create a sense of
mass, and an outer
glow layer style
ensures that the
planet fits into the
scene nicely

Fancy tentacles
of colour
The tentacles of
colour have been
created using
a stroked path,
with simulated
pressure. Each
colour is chosen
from the rainbow
to complement
and set off
against the other
elements nicely

16 Set the stars free

17 Create an aurora

18 Add streaks of light

With your gradients in place, it doesn’t quite
resemble a star field. To get the star effect,
change the layer’s blending mode to ‘Dissolve’.
This gives an instant star effect, but there are
way too many stars. Reduce the number by
adjusting both the layer’s opacity and fill values
to something around 5% for each.

Create a new layer and set the blending mode to
Colour Dodge. Using the Gradient tool, again set
to foreground-to-transparent, draw magenta and
cyan gradients around the top third of the canvas
to create a nice aurora effect. You can adjust the
opacity of the layer to control the amount of
aurora visible.

Create a new layer; foreground colour magenta.
In Brush tool, select a small round brush. Select
Pen tool. Create a curved path by clicking and
dragging in three positions. Select Paths panel,
right-click on work path and select Stroke Path.
Ensure Simulate Pressure is checked. Repeat with
different brushes to complete the effect.

Why colour
matters
If asked, “Why does colour matter?”, the most
obvious answer would be, “Because if the
world was black and white, it would be a
boring place”.
Colour matters for many reasons. Familiarity, is
one. We know bananas are yellow, the sky is blue
and the grass is green, and if that changed it
would throw us. In nature, such changes aren’t
likely, but what if overnight someone decided
that hot taps should be pink and cold taps should

be purple? Or that green no longer meant ‘go’
at traic lights?
We know blue is cold and red is hot. No other
message is needed; colour gives us all the
information we need, which is true of most
places in the world. So, in many cases, colour
transcends language as a tool for communication.
And beyond its functional uses, colour afects
moods: diferent hues evoke diferent emotions.
This has been shown by research conducted by
governments, brands and designers that reveals
the efects diferent colours have on people.
Most simply, colour brings meaning to life.
When something has colour, it acquires its own
unique style. Just by being a certain colour, an
object forms an idea in people’s minds.

“

Colour deines the
personality of a design. It’s
more powerful than shapes,
symbols and words. It’s
totally subjective, so know
your audience. Be singleminded, own a
simple colour
palette and be
remembered

”

MARK SEPHTON,
CREATIVE DIRECTOR
WWW.MARKSEPHTON.CO.UK

How colour works on the web
In the golden age of the web that we’re
experiencing now, we’re spoiled for choice
when it comes to colour. There are more options
available to us than we can physically determine
(16,777,216 to be precise) and it’s all too easy to
forget that, once upon a time, a mere 216 colours
had to suice. This is owing to the fact that
computers themselves only supported 256
colours, and in order to create a standardised
method for displaying colour, this handful of just
216 were selected. But despite today’s increase to
over 16 million, the principle for creating and
displaying colours on the web remains the same
as it has always been – through a mix of just three
basic colours: red, green and blue. Each has 256
shades that can be combined together to form
virtually any colour you could possibly imagine or
visibly recognise.
Web colours are described through the humble
Hexadecimal value - efectively a three part
algorithm made from varying intensities of Red (R),
Green (G) and Blue (B) values, starting with the
absence of all colour, black (or 00), to the presence
of all colour, white (or FF).
Before you get carried away and start dipping
your paintbrush into those 16 million colours, be
mindful of the fact that all screens can, and will,
display diferently. This is particularly relevant as
we enter the omnichannel age of web access via
tablets, phones and TVs. Never is the reality of this
disparity felt more keenly than when you design a
beautiful web concept on a 24-inch cinema
display, only for the appearance to be wildly
diferent when displayed on a client’s four-year-old
Toughbook! Put simply, the more far out the
colour you use, the higher the chance of it
displaying poorly. Neons, for example, may not
‘pop’ as much, or delicate shades of cream or grey
may not show at all. So always test on several
types of screen before signing anything of.

How to
use colour
Bevisionare.com is an
example of where colour in
digital art does the talking,
while the navigational
elements are kept in simple
monochrome. The natural
hues create an earthy
warmth when combined
with the softly rounded
shapes. The style of the
illustrations do not
immediately grab your
attention but do give a real
sense of humour.

How not to
use colour
Just because 16 million
colours exist, it doesn’t
mean you should use all of
them! While designed
purposely to attract
attention as a joke,
lingscars.com is still a
perfect example of how not
to use colour. Check out the
horrendous neon glows, the
very distracting bold paisley
background and the jarring
reds and oranges in the
middle of the page.

What colours mean
What associations are connected to diferent colours? They can go from personal preference to
becoming a symbolic representation that gets embedded as a cultural norm...
Colour psychology has long been the source of much debate, but
attempting to label colours with speciic meanings or emotions is rather
like trying to classify what efects diferent lavours have on us. It’s
personal opinion, and each individual’s understandings and perceptions of

colour will vary vastly, depending on personal experience. So while you can’t
guarantee it will have the desired efect on a viewer’s reception, clever colour
choice can – according to research – boost your chances of evoking
particular associations in the viewer’s mind.

GREEN

BLACK

ENVIRONMENTAL, FRESH, HONEST

SOPHISTICATED, POWERFUL, DEATHLY

It’s been found that people relate better
to colours that resemble those that they
experience naturally. Green represents the
earth, nature, growth and honesty. In China,
green is the symbol of health and prosperity. It’s
also widely recognised as the colour for envy.

In western culture, black has traditionally
been associated with despair, decay, death
and mourning, but it also has strong links
with power and authority. Black is also used to
convey messages of sophistication, luxury and
even elegance.

% of males that state green as their favourite colour: 14%
% of females that state green as their favourite colour: 14%

% of males that state black as their favourite colour: 9%
% of females that state black as their favourite colour: 6%

YELLOW

WHITE

BOLD, DISCOUNT, OPTIMISTIC

INNOCENT, PURE, CLEAN

Interestingly, while we generally tend to
associate yellow with bright, bold and fun,
some studies have found most people associate
yellow (along with orange) with cheap and
inexpensive attributes. They also ranked it as
one of their least favourite colours.

Technically not a colour, white is in fact the
presence of all colour. We associate it with clean
slates, freshness, new beginnings, positive
energy and life. It can turn confusion into clarity,
but too much white can also bring a sense of
empty isolation and coldness.

% of males that state yellow as their favourite colour: 1%
% of females that state yellow as their favourite colour: 3%

% of males that state white as their favourite colour: 2%
% of females that state white as their favourite colour: 1%

RED

BLUE

PASSION, WARMTH, AGGRESSION

COOL, CALM, RELIABLE

Red shares a similarity with black but has
conlicting connotations. We consider red to
be the colour of the heart, relating to love,
emotion and safety, but on the lip side, red also
symbolises warnings such as ‘danger’ and ‘stop’
and the display of rage.

Through its association with uniform and
royalty, blue also delivers a sense of trust and
authority. Many of the largest corporations (IBM,
Barclays, Facebook) use blue for this reason. But
using blue ilters in ilm can create a cold and
isolated feeling.

% of males that state red as their favourite colour: 7%
% of females that state red as their favourite colour: 9%

% of males that state blue as their favourite colour: 57%
% of females that state blue as their favourite colour: 35%

Cultural differences
HSBC ran a TV advert a couple years back that
explained that red signiies good luck and
weddings in China, whereas white represents
death and mourning. This contrasts with our
own country, where white is often the bridal
theme colour and death is represented at the
other end of the spectrum by black.
Cultural variations of colour connotations
don’t stop there. Yellow in the UK draws up
images of supermarket price reductions.
However, in Thailand yellow is the colour of

the royals, or more speciically: the king. In
Belgium, baby girls wear blue and baby boys
wear pink, which is unlike what we are used to
here. If we think of fertility, freshness and
springtime in the Western hemisphere, we
think of the colour green. The opposite is true
in South America though, where the dense
green rainforests make the locals think of
death. Green is forbidden altogether in parts
of Indonesia; a ban rooted in local culture and
a myth about the wrath of a sea goddess.

Building a brand
Most people judge based on colour, which makes colour selection vital
in building a successful brand identity
Who owns red? Who owns orange? Who owns purple? Reaching a stage
where your brand is recognised through colour alone is a testament to how
efective a marketing tool it is.
But there’s more to colour selection than something that looks nice on
packaging, TV adverts and magazines. Finding the right colour is not an easy
task and is something of an art form for many brands – not to mention a
major commitment.

Let’s look at easyJet, which is a great example thanks to its easily
recognisable branding. They arrived and turned the air travel industry upside
down with their no-frills cheaper way to fly. It was a simplistic, bold move,
and they needed a bold colour to convey their message of value and
eiciency – who else could step up to handle a task other than bright
orange? Before long, orange became more representative of easyJet than
any other brand using orange – including Orange themselves.

The easyJet brand uses a powerful orange

Orange is now intrinsically linked to the brand

Why is Facebook blue?
Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Skype and WordPress all have varying shades of blue as their primary
colour. But did they jump on Facebook’s bandwagon or is there something more?
In a study conducted in the Fourties by Faber
Birren and again in 2003 by Joe Hallock, which
explored the perception of colour, some
interesting correlations arose surrounding why
certain colours in branding evoke particular
feelings and associations better than others.
The results begin to explain why brands select
the colours they do.
The most surprising result was that both men
and women voted blue as their favourite colour.
It wasn’t by some small margin either, as 35 per
cent of all females surveyed would choose blue
over any other colour, followed by purple at 23
per cent. However 57 per cent of men cited blue
as their favourite colour with the next choice
being green at 14 per cent.
Looking at how this breaks down into age,
blue appeared top of all ages surveyed, with
people in their twenties, thirties, fourties and
ifties all choosing hues with shorter wave
lengths (blue, green, purple) compared to
younger audiences (those 19 and under) who

seem a logical choice. So with a bit of research it
would have almost been a no-brainer for the
company to choose a colour that attracted and
appealed to as many people as possible.
But what is it about blue that people love?
Again, the results of the survey speak for
themselves. Answers to the questions “what
colour do you associate with high quality, trust,
security, reliability/dependency and courage/
bravery?” were all met with blue on top. When
you think about it, what brand wouldn’t want this
type of association? So it would seem that while
not terribly original, blue statistically has a solid
purpose for its ubiquity among some of the
world’s most successful brands.
had a preference for brighter, longer-wave
colours (red, orange, yellow).
If we look at Facebook’s demographic, which
has roughly a 60 to 40 ratio leaning to a female
audience, and an average age of 40, inding a
colour popular among the typical user would

Pick the perfect palette
If you’re in the fortunate position where no brand guidelines are determining the colours for your next
piece of work, here’s a selection of palettes to get the grey matter whirring
RED OR DEAD

NINETIES NEONS

Red is one of the hardest colours to work with, but can also be one of
the most memorable when done correctly. Coca-Cola are a testament to
that. Think carefully before selecting red for your designs though, and
consider speciically
what type of red.
Try it out on several
types of screen.
It’s not the easiest
colour to work with
in print, nor read
from, but if done
well it can create a
look of high energy
and excitement.

Hot right now with the resurgence of Nineties fashion, neon colours are
steadily inding their way back into designers’ palettes. Use of clashing
electric blues and sunglass-inducing-pinks are the order of the day. It’s
a style that screams
young, fun, vibrancy
and life, but despite
the playful nature,
these colours still
require careful
selection to ensure
your design doesn’t
end up looking like a
gunge tank from Pat
Sharp’s Fun House.

PRIMARY’S COOL...

THE BLUES

When handled with care and consideration, the vibrancy of the primary
colours – red, blue and yellow – can create an impactful and powerful
look. Think Google and ebay for great examples of where this has
worked well. The
bright, contrasting
colours mean
everything else has
to be kept simple, so
go minimal. Clean
lines and bold, sans
serif, geometric
typefaces create
a stylish feel and
sense of humour.

As we have discovered, blue is widely considered the most popular
colour in the world according to research. You may therefore be torn
between siding with its popularity or dismissing it as overused – but
you can still make
it unique. Start
by exploring the
varying shades for
a sense of calm and
depth and don’t
always opt for the
corporate hues;
try turquoise, sky
blue and navy for a
modern take.

BLACK AND WHITE
The classic. Love it or hate it, you know where
you are with it. Though be warned, once you
get heavily into using monochrome it’s hard to
pair it with other colours without spoiling the
minimalist feel. Generally, when using black and
white you should ensure that you introduce
colour through imagery. Use large, bold photos
so the design of the website becomes a mere
hanger for the content. And when you do select
the right colour, the page will really ‘pop’.

Tools you can trust
Never feel a new colour palette has to just magically appear in your
mind - get out there to gain inspiration for new ideas
ADOBE KULER
Over the years, the designer’s sidekick, Kuler
(pronounced ‘colour’), has gone from behemoth
lash website to nimble HTML5 application,
plugging directly into various Adobe desktop
apps. A crowd-sourced platform for thousands
of colour palettes searchable by phrase, it also
provides a wide variety of options (or “Color
Rule”) for creating your own unique palette.
There may only be ive colours to choose from

at any one time, but you can explore the most
popular palettes and ind inspiration.
The beauty of using the Kuler app is the
variety and intensity of colour that it can
provide. If you are on the lookout for a palette
that will provide a winning collection of colours,
this is undoubtedly a tool you need in your
creative arsenal. What’s more, it gets guaranteed
results, with the added bonus of being really
simple to use.

PANTONE’S TREND FORECASTING
Pantone, the long-time kings of colour, bring
you their colour-based predictions for the year
ahead. Broken down into categories for use,
gender, country and more, they make it easy to
determine the right colour for your audience
and you can even trace the sources of inluence.

COLOURZILLA COLOUR PICKER
ColourZilla is invaluable for not only poaching
colour ideas, but also for checking designs
against build. This browser plugin allows you to
simply pick any colour rendered in the page just
by clicking and dropping.

Colour trends to follow
Just because they’re in, doesn’t mean they’re right. Or does it?
Just as trends in design come and go, colours do
the same, albeit less frequently. You’ll always have
the classics: black and white, blue and grey, green
and yellow and so on. Depending on the
application, good design shouldn’t really follow a
trend but be based on suitability for purpose.
Let’s suggest fluorescent pink is the colour of the

moment. It’s in all magazines, adverts, even cars
are being sprayed in it. Now if you were asked to
design a flyer for a club night, you’d be wise
considering this as an option. Propose that same
fluorescent pink to a client who runs an exclusive
private wealth fund, however, and suddenly you’ll
end up looking considerably less smart.

Recent colour trends

Pantone’s colour for 2014 was Radiant Orchid

Making predictions on what is going to be the
next big colour is a precarious business. But, it is
the business that Pantone are in. Every year they
predict the next big colour. In one sense they
are not predicting but suggesting a colour that
designers should be using. For example, the
Pantone Colour of the Year for 2014 was Radiant
Orchid. This is a shade of purple/lilac that has yet
to permeate the world of web design. But,
remember colour can be subjective too.

WorldMags.net

What next?
It’s impossible to predict exactly where
colour trends will go next. It’s like stocks
and shares: the market could go one way
or another. The most important thing to
remember is, as a designer, to remain open
to possibilities. Don’t constrict yourself to
any speciic style purely because you like it.
Always think beyond the current fad,
research who you’re communicating with
and consider the purpose.

Pantone’s colour for 2015 is Marsala

Make a CSS expanding
navigation menu
Create a space saving menu for all screens with the help of CSS and Font Awesome
avigation menus are vital to the success of any website. The
navigation menu on a website is like a road sign on a street or a level
directory in a shopping centre. You can’t decide on your destination
without knowing all of the options available to you, and reaching that
destination would be impossible without irst knowing where you are. Just like
in real life, navigation in web design is very important and plays a major role in
a website’s usability, as well as in the user experience.
Nowadays you can see plenty of diferent types of navigation menus with
interesting, creative and unusual designs. In this tutorial, we will look at how
we can develop a simple and clean navigation menu. The menu will expand
horizontally and, when closed, will be tucked neatly away, with just the
popular Navicon icon showing. This icon (which is three horizontal or vertical

bars) is quickly becoming known as something that ‘should’ be clicked on.
To help us develop this menu, we’re also going to be using Font Awesome,
which is an iconic font, and CSS toolkit, and we will be adding some vector
icons to each menu button. So let’s get started on our expanding navigation
menu by following these easy steps!

01 Use Font Awesome
Throughout this tutorial we’ll be using Font
Awesome’s scalable vector icons, which can
instantly be customised using CSS. There are two
ways to use Font Awesome: you can use their
content delivery network CDN (as shown), or
download the whole file from the home page:
www.fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome,
which is what we’re going to do so that we can
take a peek inside the CSS file.

com/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.
min.css" rel="stylesheet">

02 Create the menu
Our first bit of HTML will be a div with five
different class names that we’ll use to position
and style our menu. Then add in an input field
and label element which we’ll use to animate the
menu. The first icon font we’ll use is the popular
Navicon which has a class name of ‘fa-bars’ as
seen below.

home button, we’re going to add in another set
of lists and wrap this within an anchor tag. This
time we’re going to target a font icon that’s called
‘fa-user’, which is a font icon that will be perfect
for our ‘about’ button.
<li>
001
002 <a href="#">
003 <ul>
004 <li><i class="fa fa-user"></i></li>
005 <li><span>about</span></li>
006 </ul>
007 </a>
008 </li>

06 Finish off the buttons

018 <a href="#">
019 <ul>
020 <li><i class="fa fa-send"></i></li>
021 <li><span>contact</span></li>
022 </ul>
023 </a>
024 </li>
025 </ul>
026 </nav>
027 </div>
028

07 Import Font Awesome
Create a new CSS file and open it up within your
favourite text editor. If you haven’t already done
so, create a new folder called CSS and put both
your new CSS file and the font-awesome.css file
in it. Now we simply import our font-awesome.css
file using the @import url rule.
001 @import url(font-awesome.css);
002

08 CSS reset

001 <div class="menu top left horizontal blue">
002 <input id="slide" name="slide"
type="checkbox">
003 <label for="slide" class="icon open">
004 <i class="fa fa-bars"></i>
005 </label>
006 </div>

To finish off our navigation we’re going to add
in another three buttons. We are going to pull
in a camera icon font for our portfolio button, a
bookmark icon for our blog button and finally a
paper plane icon for our contact button. These
seem like good icons to use, but feel free to
experiment with other available icons.

Adding in a reset to our CSS file is standard
practice these days, but we’re going to target
every element by using the asterisk symbol and
removing all margins, padding and any borders.
It’s not always a good idea to reset every single
element, but this will do nicely this time for the
purposes of this tutorial.

03 Menu buttons

001 <li>
002 <a href="#">
003 <ul>
004 <li><i class="fa fa-camera"></i></li>
005 <li><span>portfolio</span></li>
006 </ul>
007 </a>
008 </li>
009 <li>
010 <a href="#">
011 <ul>
012 <li><i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i></li>
013 <li><span>blog</span></li>
014 </ul>
015 </a>
016 </li>
017 <li>

001 * {
002 margin: 0;
003 padding: 0;
004 border: 0;
005 }
006

Inside the div that we created in the last step, let’s
start adding in our menu buttons. We’re going
to use the HTML5 <nav> element, and then give
it a class name of ‘navigation’. Then, within that
element, we need to add an unordered list. We
leave the unordered list empty for now, as we will
fill that in throughout the next few steps.
001 <nav class="navigation">
002 <ul>
003 </ul>
004 </nav>
005

04 The home button
The next step is to move on to the all-important
home button. Within our unordered list,
we’re now going to add in our buttons using
a combination of list items and additional
unordered lists. Adding a class called ‘active’ for
our first list will allow us to use that as a trigger for
when we add the CSS for our animation. Then our
class name is called ‘fa-home’, and this class pulls
in our icon fonts from the Font Awesome CSS file.
001 <li class="active">
002 <a href="">
003 <ul>

CSS combinator ~
In a couple of steps throughout this tutorial we
have used a very handy little selector called
the CSS general sibling selector. The
combinator used to notify it is the tilde
character ‘~’, which separates two simple
selectors. The general sibling selector works
by selecting all of the elements that are
siblings of a specified element.

WorldMags.net

09 Body styles
Another part of our CSS reset is to specify both
the ‘html’ and ‘body’ elements as 100% height.
This will allow our page to stretch to fit the
whole browser window. Lastly, because our
menu will be blue, we’re going to make the page
background dark, which will make our menu pop
off the page a bit better than if we were to use
white as our background colour.
001 html,
002 body {
003 height: 100%;
004 }
005 body {
006 background: #1b1b1b;
007 }

10 Menu position
Making sure the menu is in a fixed position will
prevent vertical scrollbars from popping up.
Then we’re going to use the z index to make sure
Web Design for Beginners 153

Customise
your
site
WorldMags.net
this falls above everything else. To give us some
breathing space, we will move the menu down by
50 pixels.
001
.menu {
002 position: fixed;
003 z-index: 9999;
004 margin: 50px 0 0 0px;
005 }

11 Hide the menu
Before we can have any kind of animation
occurring on the page, we will first need to create
some space. This can be done by hiding all of our
menu buttons. So, by targeting the nav element,
we can set its opacity to zero. Then, you will need
to make sure the input check box, which will be
our Navicon, is clicked. The next step is to set
its opacity to ‘1’ and you will see the menu will
appear underneath right away.
001 .menu nav {
002 -webkit-opacity: 0;
003 -moz-opacity: 0;
004 opacity: 0;
005 }
006 .menu input#slide:checked ~ nav {
007 -moz-opacity: 1;
008 -webkit-opacity: 1;
009 opacity: 1;
010 }

12 Label styles
Now we’re going to give our Navicon (the
horizontal lines) some default styles. Giving this
a position of ‘fixed’ will pull the icons up into
alignment with the Navicon. Then we make sure
that this will act like a button by adding in ‘cursor:
pointer’ and we’re going to remove the little
checkbox by specifying ‘display: none’ for the
input field.
001 .menu label {
002 position: fixed;
003 font-size: 30px;
004 cursor: pointer;
005 z-index: 9999;
006 }
007 .menu input#slide {
008 display: none;
009 }
010

13 Navicon rotation
When the Navicon is clicked on, we want it
to rotate 90 degrees by using the transform
property. This will make the menu more
appealing as it spins around once clicked on, and
then the menu will slide out from underneath.
At the moment though, the rotation is way too
quick, so let’s sort that out in the next step.

154 Web Design for Beginners

001 .menu input#slide:checked ~ label.open i {
002 -webkit-transform: rotate(90deg);
003 -moz-transform: rotate(90deg);
004 transform: rotate(90deg);
005

14 Navicon and button
transitions
With the Navicon rotating as quickly as it does,
it isn’t all that easy on the eye, so it will need to
be altered. What we really want to do is add a
little easing to it so that it will have a much nicer,
smoother rotation when it’s clicked on. The
same goes with the menu buttons. Having them
suddenly drop down in a blink of an eye isn’t
all that comfortable to look at, so we add some
easing to those too.

We’ve now spaced out our buttons using margins and have
increased the size of our icons

001 .menu label i,
002 .menu nav,
003 .menu nav ul li a span {
004 -webkit-transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
005 -moz-transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
006 transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
007 }
008

15 Space out the buttons
We’ve got the menu buttons and Navicon looking
a lot better now, so let’s add some spacing to our
buttons. Then, once we have the spacing sorted,
we can remove the bullet points. Make sure the
overflow is hidden and then increase the size of
our font icons to 20 pixels. Having the ability to
change the size of our icons is what makes Font
Awesome, awesome!
001
.menu label,
002 .menu nav ul li a i,
003 .menu nav ul li a span {
004 line-height: 60px;
005 text-align: center;
006 width: 60px;
007 height: 60px;
008 }
009 .menu nav ul {
010 list-style: none;
011 overflow: hidden;
012 }
013 .menu nav ul li a i {
014 font-size: 20px;
015 }
016

Here we used the Google Font Lato and then set the size to
16px to boost the style and impact of this design feature

Now we add some CSS to make the menu go horizontal at the
top of the page, which is where visitors expect the navigation
menu to be

16 Button text
The next step is to set the styling for our button
text. For this tutorial, we’re going to use a Google
Font called Lato, but you can experiment with
any font you want to get the desired aesthetic.
Next we will set the size to 16px and make sure

WorldMags.net

We’ve now added the background colour to our menu and all
that’s left is the menu buttons background

WorldMags.net
21 Button colour
In this last step, all we need to do is add some
colour to our menu buttons. What we’re going to
do is reverse the colours so that the background
colour to our buttons is the same colour as our
icons and the text will be the same colour as the
menu background. Lastly, let’s add in a hover
state for our button text with white as the colour
for that.
001 .menu.blue nav ul li a span {
002 background-color: #2980b9;
003 color: #3498db;
004 }
005 .menu.blue nav ul li a span:hover { color:
white;}

22 Final thoughts
The last step is to add a hover state to our button text, and our expanding horizontal menu is now complete

it’s all in upper-case. Then we’re going to set the
width to zero.
001 .menu nav ul li a span {
002 font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
003 font-size: 16px;
004 text-transform: uppercase;
005 width: 0;
006 }
007 0

17 Animate the buttons
Now this is where things get a little more
interesting. We are going to animate the buttons
by using padding – this is so that when the
buttons are hovered over, they will move to the
right by 10px. Then we need to make sure that
the active state is set and they are given a width
of 100px.
001
.menu nav ul li a:hover span {
002
width: 100px;
padding: 0 10px;
003
004 }
005 .menu nav ul li.active a span {
width: 100px;
006
padding: 0 10px;
007
008 }

18 Horizontal menu
Our main aim in this tutorial is to create a
horizontal menu, so by targeting the horizontal
class we will be able to float the list items to the
left, which will fulfil that aim and make the whole
menu horizontal. Then, by adding a negative 50
pixels to our menu, we can tighten things up a
little bit.
001 .menu.horizontal nav ul li,
002 .menu.horizontal nav ul li a span {

003 float: left;
004 }
005 .menu.left.horizontal nav {
006 margin-left: -50px;
007 }

You’ll more than likely see plenty of navigation
menus like this, especially now that responsive
webpages are now part of our design workflow.
Using vector icons such as Font Awesome will
really help make your navigation menus more
easy and fun to develop.

19 Home button
At the moment the icon for our home button is
hidden underneath the Navicon. So by adding
some margins we can push all of our buttons over
to the right slightly so the home icon will appear.
Another feature you will notice is that when you
click on both the Navicon and the home icon, the
menu will close.
001 .menu.left.horizontal input#slide:checked ~
nav {
002 margin-left: 60px;
003 }
004 .menu.right.horizontal nav {
005 margin-right: -50px;
006 }
007 .menu.right.horizontal input#slide:checked ~
nav {
008 margin-right: 60px;
009 }

20 Menu colour
In the last few steps of this tutorial we are going
to add some colour to both our menu and the
buttons. The first thing to do then is to add a
nice light blue to our menu background. Then
we will give our icons a different shade of blue,
which will be slightly darker than our main menu
background.
001
.menu.blue label,
002 .menu.blue nav ul li a ul li i {
003 background-color: #3498db; bg
004 color: #2980b9; icons
005 }

The @keyframes at-rule
Throughout this tutorial we’ve made good use of
Font Awesome, a scalable vector icon font and CSS
kit. So what are the benefits of using an icon font
instead of images and sprites? The first and best
benefit is that it is just a font. This means that you get
all of the benefits of styling that you would get with
regular text. So, for example, you can easily change
the colour and size of an icon with a little bit of CSS. It
will also render as sharp as your device will allow it to,
so there’s no need to worry about creating
Retina-ready graphics.
The other benefit of using Icon Fonts is the
performance. Since all of the icons are included in
one font file, it means that it is only one HTTP request
to load. This can really give you quite a bit of
page-load performance if you are using a number of
different icons.
The best way of adding Font Awesome to your
website is to use the CDN and add that to the head of
your HTML file.

001<link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.
com/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome. min.
css" rel="stylesheet">
The other way is to download the CSS file and link
that in as you would with a normal CSS file – which is
what we did for this tutorial.

Create CSS animated
background text

Talk to me
Talk PR is a global communication and public
relations company specialising in brand
marketing and launches, SEO and social media
management (among many other things).
They boast a very sleek and brilliantly executed
website, which features parallax delivery of
content and a simple but striking landing area.
This landing area contains little more than the
Talk PR logo to emphasise the brand, but it is
also made a significant design feature, with
an animated background that makes for an
engaging introduction to the site. The Talk
PR text feature is created using an animated
GIF background image, which is a simple and
effective way to achieve the effect. However, in
this tutorial we will create our own text with an
animated background via two distinct methods
using CSS3.

Use text to deliver a message and as an artistic element of the page

O

ver the last few years a ‘less is more’
aesthetic has taken root in web design
practice and presentation. At present,
the use of text rather than images to create initial
impact on a website is becoming more and more
widespread. The old slide shows are being replaced
with bold, stark fonts and plenty of white space.
There has also been, however, the re-emergence of
the font as an image in its own right.
This technique is predominantly being used
as an artistic element rather than a simple means
to deliver language and communicate a specific
textual message. For this reason, typography has

become a far more creative endeavour in web
design than it has been in many years. Here we will
explore just one way of turning text into a piece of
design on your website.

“Typography has
become a far more
creative endeavour
in web design”

Background text

Menu position
Unusually, the navigation menu for
the Talk PR site appears initially at
the bottom of the landing screen.
It readjusts to the top on scroll for
easier usage

Let the text do all the talking

Simplicity
The animated background
text is a striking introduction
to Talk PR’s website and the
landing page’s simplicity is a
brilliant gateway to the site’s
many features

Social media grid
Scroll down to see what
else this great site has to
offer. The responsive grid
layout below, which contains
Talk PR’s social media
updates, is particularly
pleasing and interesting

SIMPLE WORKS
Talk PR’s animated GIF
method for creating the
text background may
seem too simple for those
looking to use more modern
methods, but it works. It also
resizes smoothly within this
responsive website, which
helps avoid browser issues.

156 Web Design for Beginners

Clear links

Sliding grid links

Take a look at the impressive list of
clients for some smooth scrolling
links from each well-known client
logo. Some of them are given
colour upon rollover, which then
link to a page about the client

It’s also worth taking a look
at the blog, from one of the
front page links. It is another
good example of grid image
layout for content links that
slide into place

Old tricks, new techniques
<comment>
What our
experts think
of the site

“There was a time when this effect would have been handled quite adequately in Flash,
but in the present, HTML5 and CSS3 enable us to replicate old animation tricks without
losing device access or SEO standards. Sometimes the effects don’t change, just the
method of delivery. This website is one of those sites that could have been built for other
web designers.” Richard Lamb

02 Technique one
Image-based method
01 Create the images
Make two images. The first should be a white
background rectangle (with a width of 950px
and height of 395px), within which there is the
word “WOW!” in transparency. The second image
should be a series of background images, each
measuring the same width and height as the text
image, arranged in one long strip with a width of
4750px. Name them ‘wow.png’ and ‘bg.jpg’.

02 The base HTML
The first step of our image-based method
involves creating the base code into which our
elements will be placed. Here we are using a
simple wrapper that contains two nested divs:
the .wow div with the text PNG image and
the ‘.inner-wow’ div, which with the animated
background image.
001 <body>
002 <div id="wrap">
003 <div class="wow">
004 <div class="inner-wow"></div>
005 </div>
006 </body>

03 The base CSS
Initially, we are centring our .wow div with
automargins and setting a width of 950 pixels to
match the wrapper div, and a height of 395 pixels.
This will house the wow.png image. Within this
div we nest the .inner-wow with 100% width and
the padding values, which enable the div to fill
the height of the parent div.
001 #wrap {
002 margin:100px auto;
003 width:950px;
004 }
005 .wow {

006 width:950px;
007 height:395px;
008 background:url(wow.png);
009 }
010 .inner-wow {
011 width: 100%;
012 padding: 0% 0 41%;
013 }

04 Arrange the background
Declare the bg.jpg image as the background
to the .inner-wow div. Hide the overflow to be
safe and then begin declaring your animation
styles for the background. The next step will be
to tweak the duration to suit. Don’t forget to add
vendor prefixes for non-webkit browsers. At the
end we will add a relative position and a minus
scale z-index to ensure that the image always
remains present and correct in the background.
001 .inner-wow {
002 ...
003 background: #fff url(bg.jpg) repeat;
004 overflow: hidden;
005 -webkit-animation-name: bg;
006 -webkit-animation-duration: 35s;
007 -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite;
008 -webkit-animation-timing-function: linear;
009 position: relative;
010 z-index: -1;
011 }

05 Add the keyframes
Our animation won’t do anything if we don’t
assign the keyframes to it. The particular set we
are using involves a relatively simple animation,
where the background image slides from right to
left and then repeats on an infinite loop. When
in place, the background image will continually
pop from one image to the next. Once again,
remember to include vendor prefixes.
001 @-webkit-keyframes bg {
0% { background-position: 0%
002
50%; }
100% { background-position:
003
100% 0%; }
004 }
005 @-moz-keyframes bg {
006 }
007 @keyframes bg {
008 }

WorldMags.net

03 Technique two
Text-based method
This technique looks at an alternative
animation, where the same effect is created
with actual text, rather than a background
image. However, this process uses the webkitonly property ‘-webkit-background-clip:
text’, which currently only works on webkitenabled browsers.

01 Use a span
Set the wrap to the same dimensions as used
in the previous technique steps. Discard the
wow.png but retain the bg.jpg image. This
time, instead of using an image within the
.wow div, we’ll use a simple <span> element.
Write your chosen word within it.
001 <div id="wrap">
002 <span>WOW!</span>
003 </div>
004

02 The CSS
Replicate the font, font-size and, if required,
font-weight used for the text image from
the previous method. Use the original
background image, but this time as the
background for the span.
001 span {
002 position:absolute;
003 font-family: 'Open Sans',
sans-serif;
004 font-size:300px;
005 font-weight:800;
006 background:url(bg.jpg);
007 }
008

03 Add properties
Now for the properties – add these and the
background-clip and text-fill-colour too,
which enables the background image to
display within the confines of the span text.
This will, in effect, turn the text into a mask.
We will replicate the animation from the
previous method, as well as the keyframes.
001 span {
002 ...
003 -webkit-background-clip:
004 -webkit-text-fill-color:
transparent;
005 -webkit-animation: bg 20s
linear infinite;
006 }
007

Use images as interactive elements in your webpage

I

n addition to the recent trends in web design
towards typo graphics, there has also been a
shift in the use of images. As broadband speeds
increase and web delivery methods refine, it’s no
longer detrimental to the load-time of a website if
it‘s heavy with large images. This enables imagery
to be used as part of more interactive elements,
such as navigation links. CSS now provides a
wealth of possibilities to animate, embellish and
enhance online imagery, and turn your images
into interactive elements. In this tutorial, we will
look at the process behind creating an image grid,

complete with CSS hover effects and animated
captions. It’ll be easy for you to animate your
webpage, making it more beautiful and interactive.

Wood Shed Production is an American
company that specialises in hand-crafted art
made from reclaimed wood. They sell their
wares in local markets but also on Etsy, and
use their website as an introduction for the
company and a channel for all of their specialist
orders. In effect, it serves as a shop front for
making sales and building brand awareness.
The site features a large quantity of imagery, as
well as an initial full-width video background. It
is simple, well laid out and extremely evocative
of the workshop environment, making it an
authentic representation of the business and
its products. Scroll down and you’ll find an
Instagram-based, gallery-style image grid with
the style of hover effect that we will be using as
the basis of this tutorial.

“There has also been
a shift in the use

Look carefully as you scroll up and down,
and you’ll see a parallax background (of a

The Instagram image grid
elements are initially black

them transforms each
element into a full-colour
image, with a fade-in caption

IMAGE USE
It doesn’t take much work at
all to use your images as the
basis for smooth, eye-catching,
interactive effects. As with the
Wood Shed Production site,
try to see your images as more
than just pictures to be placed
in a window for display.

Browser lag
<comment>
What our
experts think
of the site

“Building with CSS3 can sometimes bring home just how inconsistent browser support for
the newer web technologies is. While Internet Explorer has improved vastly over the last
few years, IE10 seemed to take some steps back. Even Firefox has fallen behind with certain
CSS properties. Time for better browser standardisation?” Richard Lamb

02 Technique
Set up the image wall
01 Build the base HTML
Start by building the first cell in our grid. The
cell div contains an image with caption div
underneath. These are wrapped in an ‘a’ link,
repeat it for the images you use, then adjust the
pic and caption for each cell.

02 Set cell sizes
Make sure that our images will adjust themselves
to fit the cell divs when set to a 25% width.
Equally sized images are essential for this grid.
Note that the cell divs can have a finite width. The
relative position will come into play when the
caption is styled in the next few steps.
001 img {
002 max-width:100%;
003 border:none; /*for IE*/
004 }
005 .cell {
006 position: relative;
007 overflow: hidden;
008 width:25%;
009 height:auto;
010 float:left;
011 }

03 Use the caption CSS
We are using the caption div as an overlay to the
image, giving it an absolute position and 100%
width and height. We will go on to style it in the
next step. Choose your own background colour
but rgba with opacity will give you transition on
hover. Remember your vendor prefixes for the
transition declaration.
001 .caption {
002 position: absolute;
003 top: 0;
004 left: 0;
005 width: 100%;
006 height: 100%;
007 background:rgba(31,31,31,0.8);
008 transition: all 0.6s ease;
009 }

Fade the colour
To de-saturate images and saturate on hover,
we use the grayscale filter property. This is
fully supported in Chrome and IE6 to 9, with
some support in Safari.

04 Set the H2 CSS tag
The actual caption H2 tag also has an absolute
position to place and move it. Font size, colour
and family can be at your discretion. Set an
initial opacity of 0.1, to hint at the caption before
hovering. We’ll use the transform property to
animate the caption as it fades in. Begin with a
-30px height from the 0 bottom property.
001 .caption h2 {
002 position: absolute;
003 bottom: 0;
004 left: 0;
005 margin:0;
006 padding: 15px;
007 opacity:0.1;
008 transition: all 0.6s ease;
009 transform: translate3d(0,-30px,0);
010 }
011

05 Change the hover effects
Now it’s time to tie up the hover effects. First lift
the opacity on the caption background, which
will reveal the image, and increase the opacity of
the H2 tag to full. Animate the H2 tag by reducing
that -30 pixel distance back to 0, using the
transition to ease the animation.
001 .caption:hover {
002 background:rgba(31,31,31,0);
003 transition: all 0.6s ease;
004 }
005 .caption:hover h2 {
006 opacity:1;
007 text-shadow: 1px 1px #1f1f1f;
008 transition: all 0.6s ease;
009 transform: translate3d(0,0,0);
010 }
011

01 Focus on cell
The key to implementing the filter is to make
the cell div the focus of the hover action. Add
the following to the .cell CSS, and change
every instance of .caption:hover to .cell:hover
through original animations.
001 .cell {
002 ...
003 -webkit-filter: grayscale(1); /*
webkit versions */
004 -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%);
005 filter: grayscale(100%);
006 filter: gray; /* IE6-9 */
007 transition: all 0.6s ease;
008 }

Older

02 Add a new hover effect
Now add filter property transition and simply
eliminate the grayscale filter with an easing
transition. You can adjust the opacity levels of
the original caption div now that images load
in black and white.
001 .cell:hover {
002 -webkit-filter:
grayscale(0); /* Older webkit
versions */
003 -webkit-filter: grayscale(0%);
004 filter: grayscale(0%);
005 filter: none; /* IE6-9 */
006 transition: all 0.6s ease;
007 }

03 Colour or monochrome
Either as links to relevant destinations within the site
or simply gallery images in their own right, adding
some animation and CSS reveals to your images can
make a world of difference.

WorldMags.net

Using the grayscale filter to ease between
monochrome and colour produces a very
eye-catching effect. It may not be fully
supported, but there are JavaScript fallbacks
and SVG alternatives as browsers catch up.

Animate a strike-through text effect
Learn how to add this nifty effect to your text

T

he problem with descriptive language
is that the addition or omission of a
single word, or even a comma, can give a
completely different meaning to the message
being communicated. Creative design can use
this flaw in language to emphasise the difference
between one meaning and another. In our
example, we use the text ‘I am not invincible’
with animation to emphasise the omission of
‘not’, thereby changing the meaning of the
sentence. This effect has been used to good
advantage on the McClaren agency website to
emphasise the agency’s excellence. This tutorial
shows how standard CSS without support from

JavaScript can be used to redefine the standard
<strike> tag to present an animated strikethrough effect. The advantage of this approach
is how it can be applied to websites containing
massive amounts of existing content. All that is
required is the addition of the CSS – no HTML
modifications whatsoever!
The approach used in this tutorial provides a
standard fallback for modern browsers that don’t
support the animation effect. For older versions
of Internet Explorer that don’t support the
before selector, you might want to use the ‘if
IE’ HTML tags to reactivate the standard strikethrough effect.

TEXT: THE BOTTOM LINE
Despite the design focus being on the strike-through
effect, it’s important that the focus is on how the text is
interpreted in all circumstances. The primary consideration
is the wording used. Make sure to be critical of how the
meaning of the text can be interpreted with and without
the text struck through.
Another important consideration when integrating
this effect into your web content is the use of a fallback
feature. It could be a failure for the strike-through text
not to appear on browsers that don’t support some CSS
features. So the original text would appear without the
strike-through effect. Imagine this: ‘XYZ premium brand,
delivering [average] quality since 1984’, but without the
[average] struck through. So bare in mind contractually
obliging text, like the well-known UK catalogue chain who
had to sell TVs for £1 due to a wording error on their site.

Strike-through animations

Strike importance
Make sure that the strikethrough effect is visible on all
browsers to avoid embarrassing
wording slipping through

Strike colour
Unlike the standard strike-through
effect offered by HTML and CSS,
this line is a different colour to the
main text

Strategic wording
The wording is written to make full
use of the strike-through effect, and
to change the context on each read

Legacy content
Using the standard <strike>
tag will allow the effect to be
compatible with all content
without needing HTML changes

Semantic meaning
The <strike> tag provides
context to the text, allowing
apps and search engines
to understand what is
happening

WorldMags.net
01 Initiate webpage
As usual, the first step is to define the webpage document. This consists of the
<html> document container, which contains the <head> section and the main
content <body>. This is the foundation for the next steps to be inserted.
001 <!DOCTYPE html>
002 <html>
003 <head>
004 <title>Text Strike</title>
005 *** STEP 3 HERE
006 </head>
007 <body>
008 *** STEP 2 HERE
009 </body>
010 </html>

001 text-align: center;
002 }

06 Default strike display
This is the step where we start to define the properties of the strike-through
text. We need to ensure that <strike> elements display as an inline-block, are
relatively positioned and don’t show the default strike-through effect. These
are all required to ensure that the strike-through effect covers the text as it
was intended.
001 strike{
002 display: inline-block;
003 position: relative;
004 text-decoration: none;
005 }

07 Strike element: default

02 Insert content
With the webpage document now in place, the next step is to insert the
content into the document body. We will use an <article> container with
different types of text – each having a word ‘not’ struck through using the
<strike> tag.
001 <article>
002 <h1>I am <strike>not</strike> invincible!</
h1>
003 <h2>I am <strike>not</strike> invincible!</
h2>
004 <h3>I am <strike>not</strike> invincible!</
h3>
005 <p>I am <strike>not</strike> invincible!</
p>
006 </article>

03 CSS link
The last part of the HTML document is to link to the CSS stylesheet – this
enables the styling to be kept separate from content for easier maintainability.
Insert this HTML into the head section and create a file called ‘styles.css’.
001 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />

04 Body style
Start the CSS by defining the styles of the page body. This will have a dark
colour background with white text. Ensure that the default text size is set to
40 pixels.
001 body {
002 background: #222;
003 padding: 1em;
004 color: #fff;
005 font-size: 40px;
006 }

05 Article container
For presentation, we will make all content within the <article> container
positioned in the centre.

The strike effect is created as an element inserted before the <strike>
element – we achieve this using the :before selector and we also need to set
content for it to be visible. The CSS is designed to ensure that all browsers
show the cross-out effect by default – even if the animation effect isn’t
supported. We don’t want some people reading the wrong message.
001 strike:before {
002 content: '';
003 position: absolute;
004 display: block;
005 width: 100%;
006 height: .1em;
007 margin-top: .6em;
008 background: red;
009 animation: strikethrough 1s;
010 }

08 Strike element: animation
For browsers that can show the animation, we need to attach an animation
to the element that we’ve created. We are going to call the animation
‘strikethrough’ and we will want this to last for one second – hence 1s.
001 strike:before {
002 animation: strikethrough 1s;
003 }

09 Animation definition
With the presentation rules for the strike-through effect in place, the last task
is to define how the animation works. This is simply a case of stating that the
width of the element starts from 0 per cent and ends at 100 per cent.
001 @keyframes strikethrough {
002 from {
003 width:0;
004 }
005 to {
006 width:100%;
007 }
008 }

Create email newsletters and
let people subscribe
Creating a newsletter script for your site need not be
hard with a little help from MailChimp

I

n order to promote your website or the subject of your website, you
may consider producing an email newsletter. These are sent out to
subscribers, keeping them up-to-date with the latest additions to your
webpages. The idea is that it keeps driving traic back to the site among
those who have already expressed an interest in it, allowing you to show
them that you are still up and running and that there's plenty of content
to keep visitors coming back for more.
In order to be efective, you will want to add a newsletter script to your
webpage. This will produce a form into which people can insert their
contact information and sign up for your regular updates. This is a great
way to capture marketing data for targeting interested individuals. Once
subscribed, they will automatically receive your newsletter every time you
produce one. It can also be a good idea to have an Unsubscribe
button somewhere on your website, maybe in the
About Us section, as subscribers are more likely
to try it out if they know they can leave.
The easiest way to set up a
newsletter script is via MailChimp.
Although the service can charge, if you
have fewer than 2,000 subscribers and don’t send
more than 12,000 emails each month, there is no charge at all.
You don’t need to input any payment details either to sign up, which is
a plus. MailChimp is easy to use and it is all done online with menus and
wizards, ensuring you will be up and running in next to no time.

01 Sign up to MailChimp

02 Create a list

Go to www.mailchimp.com and click the Sign Up Free button. Fill in your
email, username and password where prompted and you’ll then be sent an
email with a link. Click this to activate your account. Complete the sign up
with your name, address and website details.

The first thing you need to do to get your newsletter up and running is to
create a list into which the subscriber details will be inserted. Give it a name,
say who you want the emails to come from, give a reply address and a
default email subject.

Add social media buttons
Learn to add social media buttons to your website
to connect with users and boost interactivity

O

ver the past few years the web has increasingly become a
true social platform. Networks such as Facebook and YouTube
now boast over a billion users each. For someone involved in
creating a website, this is a terrific opportunity. Social networks democratise
content sharing, so that if your website strikes a chord with users of these
networks, the networks themselves become a effective promotion platform.
There’s nothing to stop you from regularly posting a link to different
pages on your website and encouraging your friends and followers to share
your link, but this is really only scratching the surface of the power of social
networks. Instead of relying on you to post, it can be far more effective to
encourage visitors to your website to post to their wall or tweet in
response to your site.
In truth, anyone could post a link to your site
on their wall or stream as a matter of
course, and some of the most
dedicated social network
users might, but for the majority of
people there needs to be both a reminder
and an easy one-click way to post. Webmasters can
address this by creating social media buttons with recognisable
logos, which are designed to facilitate easy posting to the visitor’s wall,
adding to their channel or tweeting.

Breaking it down
There are many different social
networks available

Standard buttons
All the common social networks are available, including
the likes of Twitter and Facebook, so you can choose
which networks to include and appeal to within your set
of buttons. Here we’ve opted for just Facebook

Recognisable logos
Users of social networks recognize
the standard buttons for their
preferred network. This means that
you shouldn’t change the way a
Facebook Like buttons looks, unless
you feel it’s worth the risk that
visitors won’t recognize the button
for what it is

Extended functionality
Some services allow you to create
your own custom buttons to
perform additional actions on the
page, such as printing, converting to
PDF or other custom actions

Integrate with your page

SOCIAL NETWORKS

Social media buttons are great
promotional tools, but you don’t
want them to overpower the content
you’re offering, so make sure they
are an appropriate size – not too big,
but not so small you can’t find them

Over the past few years, the concept of social networks has
exploded. Instead of being limited to a couple of major players,
we now have dozens of different options available to us. This
can make it difficult to keep up with, and particularly to cater
for, all the networks. To avoid clutter, focus on the primary
options unless your website uses a particular specialist network.

accounts, choose the Follow Buttons tab at the top. This tab allows you to
choose the type of buttons again, but you’ll need to enter details of your
username for each network you’d like to include.

Once you’re happy with your selection of buttons, copy and paste the copy
from the right hand column of the page into your web page’s HTML code.
The buttons will appear exactly where you paste the code, so be careful to
place them where you intend them to render.

Add Twitter Cards to your site
Twitter allows you to show a special card of information when your page is linked to it within a tweet

T

witter is a great way to engage with your visitors, and can help to drive
traffic to your website. An ideal way to encourage visitors to tweet a link to
your pages is to include a tweet button in your design, but a shortened link
isn’t the most eye-catching, attention grabbing advert for your website. Fortunately,
there is a way you can enhance tweets that link to your website, whether it’s you
sending the tweet or one of your visitors. This is done with the help of Twitter cards.
What are Twitter cards? Twitter cards make it possible for you to attach additional
information to tweets when your website is linked within a tweet. These cards can
take a few different forms, and will show up slightly differently according to whether
you access the Twitter service through the main www.twitter.com website, or
through different Twitter apps.
There are six different card types you can choose from, each of which has a
different layout and, as Twitter puts it, consumption experience. The principal
options are the Summary Card, which provides a title, description, thumbnail image
and Twitter account link; the Large Image Summary Card, which is similar but adds
a large image in place of the thumbnail; the Photo card, which provides a single
image; and the Gallery Card, which offers space for a number of images. There are
also specialist cards for video and audio, apps and product listings.
In this tutorial we’ll show you how to create one of the basic card types, install
it on your website, and test the results with the Cards Validator service. Using this,
you can add other cards to your website. Depending on your website's layout and
content placement, take a call as to which card will look best on it.

Glossary
WorldMags.net

Web design
glossary

As with most specialisms, there are many
specific terms that relate to web design. We
look through some of the key terms to clear
up any confusion

Above the fold

AJAX

Blog

Anything that resides in the web browser
window when your webpage first loads is
referred to as above the fold. Imagine it as a large
newspaper – above the fold is the top part with
the name of the paper.

Standing for asynchronous JavaScript and XML,
AJAX is a group of technologies which include
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows data from a
web server to be loaded after a webpage has
loaded, without altering its performance.

Short for weblog. It’s a common form of website
in which small items of news or opinion are
frequently posted.

Accessibility

Backlink

Breadcrumb

This is the extent to which a website can be used
by people with a disability. Ideally, a website will
be accessible for people with visual and hearing
problems and those who are colour blind or
physically disabled.

A link that refers users from another website
to yours. The more the merrier because search
engines look for the number of quality links to
your site to help raise its rankings.

Refers to the navigation elements at the top of
the webpage. These not only show you the site
you are on but where it lies in the site hierarchy
so that you can see the process of clicks that got
you there. It can enhance navigation because
they can quickly get to a higher-level page.

Bandwidth

Captcha

Address bar

The amount of data requested from your website.
Your host web server will have a set limit and you
may be charged extra if you go over. Either that
or requests are denied.

Captchas are places within web forms. They are
the sometimes undecipherable words which you
have to work out and type in when you want
to submit a form within a site. The idea behind
making you type these correctly is to reduce
the levels of spam that would otherwise be
generated from automated computer bots.

Also referred to as the URL bar. This is where you
type in the web address in a browser.

Content management
system (CMS)
A CMS manages aspects of your site using
a backend tool. Popular examples include
WordPress. Commonly, you will be able to create
posts, add headlines, text and images within a
simple form in the admin area for your site that,
when published, appear online. The various
elements are usually separated so that content is
set aside from design.

Cookie
Cookies are useful for remembering what a
visitor did when they last landed on a webpage.
A cookie can hold all sorts of data including any
customised elements, ensuring they do not have
to tailor the site for their needs each time.

CSS
Content management systems such as WordPress remove the hassle of coding and ensure updating a site is easy

170 Web Design for Beginners

WorldMags.net

Cascading style sheets have superseded HTML
tables, telling a web browser how its pages

WorldMags.net
GIF
An image file which refers to graphic interchange
format. GIFs can also be animated. In that case
a series of images (or maybe just two) is created
and it gives an illusion of movement.

Hosting
A website has to be stored on a computer. This
is referred to as a server. The server has to be
connected to the internet. Servers are owned
by host companies, hence hosting is the act of
providing the service.

HTML

Here you can see how this site shows a breadcrumb trail, letting you jump to football or sport very quickly

should look. The language specifies the layout
and style of a site, giving information about the
fonts, colour, typeface, border, alignment, width,
height and much more.

Domain
A website domain refers to the name of the site.
For example imagine-publishing is the domain
for the publisher of this bookazine. The .co.uk
suffix is the domain’s extension.

Dots per inch
DPI refers to the resolution of an image. Typically
an image for the web will need to be 72dpi. This
is low when compared to print. The images in this
bookazine, for example, are 300dpi.

can be copied and pasted into the relevant area
of your own page code. The site will then pull in
content, be it a video, tweets, images and more.

Favicon
The 16x16 pixel icon which appears next to the
address bar in the browser to identify the site.

Focal point
The area where the eye is naturally drawn is
called the focal point, so you need to make sure
that if something is catching the attention more
than anything else, that it is the part you wish to
draw attention to. A focal point can be anything,
but you want it to stand out.

Font family
Fonts refer to the characters that make up the
words on your webpage. A font family is a group
of typefaces which look similar, for example Arial
and Arial Black, Arial MT Std and so on.

Hypertext markup language enables you to
create webpages. It is an adaptable language
that is used to provide website content and
can incorporate elements of design. HTML5 is
the latest iteration and it adds new syntactical
features including <video> and <audio>.

HTTP
Hypertext transfer protocol is most often used as
part of a URL. It sets out the rules of exchange on
the web between the server and browser. HTTP
does this over a secure and encrypted connection
and it is used when sensitive information is being
sent online.

Hyperlink
Where text or an image can be clicked so that
the user is sent to another page or website, this
is referred to as a hyperlink. When hyperlinks
are carried within text, they will be shown in a
different colour or underlined. The cursor will also
change when a hyperlink is available on a section
of your webpage.
Hyperlinks are familiar to web users. Often coloured
or underlined, they point you to other areas of the
website or internet

Font weight
The thickness or thinness of a font.

Form
Shopping carts are key features of eCommerce websites and will be
identifiable to anyone who has bought items online

eCommerce
Sites which allow the buying and selling of items
online are examples of eCommerce.

Rather than just have a link to an email address
(<a href=”mailto:youremail@email.com>email</
a>), you can use a form. They are great for
interactivity and for allowing people to fill in
details directly on the page. You can code them
yourself or use third-party software to generate
a form which can then be embedded.

Embed code
Many sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter
and so on allow you to feed their content into
your own site. This is done via embed code, which

iframe

Metadata

An iframe is used when you want to display more
than one webpage in a single page. You could,
therefore, have two webpages. For example,
there could be a menu where clicking on a
hyperlink will open a new webpage in a frame on
the same page while retaining the menu area.

Within the <head> of an HTML document, it is
possible to write metatags. These are hidden
from view so visitors cannot see them, but search
engines will find and make use of such metadata.

Image map
Coded in XHTML, an image map is a picture that
is broken down into different clickable areas, each
of which send the user to different URLs.

Liquid layout

Navigation

A website with a liquid layout will alter depending
on the physical size of the browser window. So
if someone minimises their browser, the content
will optimise to fit the window, whereas a nonliquid layout will hide some of the content. The
containers on the page have their widths defined
in percentage terms.

Refers to the way people move around your
webpages. Your navigation needs to be as simple
as possible so that people do not become lost.
Navigation is usually in the form of menus but it
can also be via links on a page.

In HTML, this refers to a white-space character.
Use it when a single white-space is needed such
as when indenting a line. It is also referred to by
the indicator &nbsp;.

A file format which reduces an image’s file size,
therefore making pictures quicker to download
when they are placed within a webpage.

Keywords
Search engines are important because they
point people to your website. Search engine
optimisation is therefore crucial and keywords –
the terms that people will use to search for your
page or content – are one element of that. A
keyword used prominently on a page will ensure
better ranking.

Non-breaking space

Outbound link
A hyperlink which sends people to another
website. Also called an external link.

PDF
This is an example of a non-liquid layout where resizing the
browser cuts into the page. A liquid layout readjusts to fit

WorldMags.net

A portable document format file provides
information in a layout that is fixed. PDFs can be

WorldMags.net
used for a variety of purposes, such as making a
printed leaflet available to download from your
site or a timetable of events that's too intricate to
be placed on a webpage.

Plug-in
Some web content requires a plug-in – an extra
piece of software that expands the possibilities
of an existing app. For a browser, for instance,
you could have a Flash plug-in to be able to play
Flash video. Plug-ins are also available for content
management systems. An example of this is an
eCommerce plug-in for WordPress to allow users
to set up an online store and accept payments.

Podcast
Web design is not just about the visual. You
should be aiming for all sorts of content,
including audio. A podcast – which can also
be video – is a recording to which visitors can
subscribe or download.

Responsive Design
Reponsive Design has become a buzzword for
websites. It basically means creating a website
that can be used efficiently across all platforms.
It ensures consistent user experience whether on
a PC, mobile device or tablet, irrespective of your
screen and resolution size. It's soon becoming
mandatory for web designers to adhere to
responsive design as their website can be viewed
on any device.

RSS
Really simple syndication not only allows
websites to pull in content feeds from other sites,
but it also allows web managers to give visitors
the option of subscribing to their feeds. A feed
will typically show you a website’s headlines and
sometimes the first paragraph of text.

Script
JavaScript is an example of a script, a code that
is placed within an HTML page that produces
interactive and dynamic elements. This could be
a drop-down menu or pop-ups.

SEO

Many websites make it simple to add dynamic content via embed code such as this on the YouTube site

Sitemap

Traffic

If you have lots of content, a sitemap can be used
to make sense of it. It is a list of all of the items
within your site, organised by their hierarchy or
importance, depending on the type of site.

When people come to your site for whatever
reason, they will download data. The amount
they transfer is called traffic, although this term
is also used to describe the number of people
visiting a site.

Social media
Most people are a dab hand with social media
nowadays. From Facebook to Blogger, Twitter
to YouTube, there is a rich tapestry of content
provided by users. These elements can be
inserted into a webpage. They help to drive
people to your site too. The developer areas of
such sites often carry embed code and individual
elements are also embeddable.

WYSIWYG

Template

XHTML

Commonly associated with content management
systems, templates (and themes) give websites a
standardised and consistent look and feel, which
helps to ensure they appear more professional.

Standing for extensible hypertext markup
language, it refers to HTML which complies with
XML rules.

Text editor
A fancy web design package is not needed if you
know HTML. All you need is a simple text editor
program such as Notepad on the PC, saving the
file with the extension .html.

'What you see is what you get' refers to a
program that will publish a webpage on the
internet that appears exactly as it did within the
app. One good example of this is Apple’s intuitive
and easy-to-use iWeb. It basically means that you
will see a webpage exactly as you published it.
This is a good starting point for beginners.

XML
Extensible markup language is a markup
language used to write other markup languages.

Search engine optimisation is the act of
enhancing your website so that it is picked up by
the likes of Google and Bing. It’s a complicated
area but metadata, inbound and outbound
links and allowing RSS feeds to encourage your
content to be used within other sites helps.

Shopping cart
Online shops do not usually require you to buy
items individually. Most often you place them in
a basket or cart and then check out, paying for
them all at the same time.

Having a captcha on a web form bars it from being overrun by
automated bots that scour the web and randomly fill them in
