About the Author
David A. Crowder has authored or coauthored nearly 30 books on subjects
ranging from computers to historical mysteries, including popular bestsellers
such as Sherlock Holmes For Dummies, Building a Web Site For Dummies and
CliffsNotes Getting on the Internet. He was selling hypertext systems back in
the days when you had to explain to people what the word meant. He’s been
involved in the online community since its inception and is the recipient of
several awards for his work, including NetGuide Magazine’s Gold Site Award.
He is the son of a teacher and a college president, and his dedication to
spreading knowledge, especially about the computer revolution, goes beyond
his writing. He also founded three Internet mailing lists (discussion groups),
JavaScript Talk, Java Talk, and Delphi Talk, all of which were sold to ZiffDavis. One of his most treasured memories is the message he received from
an old-timer on one of those lists who said that he had never seen such a free
and open exchange of information since the days when computers were built
by hobbyists in home workshops.
When he isn’t writing, he spends his time with his wife Angela, wandering
through villages in the Andes or frolicking in the Caribbean surf.

Dedication
For Angela. Eres mi sol, nena, eres mi luna.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks are due to Steven Hayes, Christopher Morris, Barry Childs-Helton,
and James Russell, my fine editors, who were there for me every step of the
way. Sometimes the relationship between writers and editors is smooth as
silk, and sometimes it’s tempestuous, but it always results in a better book
through the give-and-take of the writing/editing process — and I’m grateful
for the critiques and contributions of all the members of the Wiley team.
All helped to make this the best book we could put together for you. And
they’re just the tip of the iceberg: About a zillion people work their tails off
anonymously and behind the scenes at Wiley to bring you the finest books
they can possibly produce. My hat is off to all of them, from the top editors
to the humblest laborer on the loading dock. Last, but by no means least,
I’d like to say how much I appreciate all the hard work done by my literary
agent, Robert G. Diforio, without whose help I would be lost in the intricacies
of the publishing world.

xviii Building a Web Site For Dummies, 4th Edition

Introduction

M

aybe you already have your own Web site and you’re not quite satisfied with it. Or perhaps you’re still in the planning stages and want
to know what you can do to make your site as good as it can be. You’ve been
to Web sites that have all the bells and whistles, and you wouldn’t be human
if you weren’t just a wee bit envious. Well, now you can have it all too. In
Building a Web Site For Dummies, 4th Edition, I show you some of the best
stuff around, and I tell you just how to go about putting it on your site.

About This Book
This isn’t just another Web design book. It’s special. Really. I set out to write
the one book I’d want by my side if I were looking to set up a really fancy
Web site and not break the bank doing it. I tracked down and tested zillions
of Web-site enhancements and selected the top of the line to share with you.
And I’m honestly proud of the results. I’ve authored or coauthored more
than 20 books on computers and the Internet, and this one is my hands-down
favorite.
It’s full of things you’re sure to love. It’s packed with fun stuff, but it’s got
plenty of serious stuff, too, like how to get past the hype and really make
money through your Web site. You’ll wonder how in the world you ever got
along without having these features on your Web site.

How to Use This Book
Keep this book next to your computer and never lend it to anybody. It’s far
too precious for that. Make your friends buy their own copies. If you need to
make space on your bookshelf, throw away anything else you own to make
room for it. When you travel, take it with you. Hold it in your arms at night
and tell it how much you love it.
Each chapter is a stand-alone entity. (Don’t you just love that word?) You don’t
have to read the whole thing, and it’s a rare person who will read the book from
cover to cover right off the bat. Go ahead — hit the table of contents or the index

2

Building a Web Site For Dummies, 4th Edition
and jump to the parts you’re most interested in. But don’t forget to explore the
rest of the book after you’re done with the parts that excite you most. You won’t
regret spending the time — you’ll find wonders in every chapter.

Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you have a favorite Web-page creation program — whether it’s
Dreamweaver, plain old Notepad, or the UNIX-based text editor vi — and
you know how to use it. So when I say to copy and paste text or save your
file, you know what you need to do. Just in case you don’t have a good
Web-authoring program, I include sources for some good HTML editors
in this book.

Conventions Used in This Book
It’s all organized; I promise. Even though it’s rather plebeian compared with
finding free content for your site, lots of people worked very hard to make
sure that this book follows some straightforward rules and typographical
conventions.
Code listings, of which there are plenty, look like this:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<SCRIPT>
...
</SCRIPT>
<TITLE>
...
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
...
HTML elements in this book are in uppercase, and their attributes are in lowercase, as in this example:
<INPUT type=”hidden” name=”answer” value=”yes”>
If the value of an attribute is in normal type, you enter it exactly as shown. If
it’s in italics, it’s only a placeholder value, and you need to replace it with a
real value. In the following example, you replace myownimage with the name
of the image file you intend to use:
<IMG src=”myownimage”>

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts. I organized it that way, with a little
help from the folks you see in the Acknowledgments. You did read the
Acknowledgments, didn’t you? Don’t tell me that you’re the kind of person
who reads the Introduction but doesn’t read the Acknowledgments. Please
tell me that you didn’t miss the Dedication, too?
Each part has chapters in it. And each chapter has headings and subheadings. All the sections under these headings and subheadings have text that
enlightens the heart and soul. Here, take a look.

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
Part I spills the secrets of how to plan a successful site from the ground up.
It tosses in a quick refresher course in basic HTML, then goes into more
depth with some of the more advanced approaches such as tables and
frames. Toss in a look at WYSIWYG site creation and some advice on getting
your material on the Net, and you’re ready to transform a bunch of Web pages
into a coherent Web site.

Part II: Building Better Web Pages
Part II introduces you to Cascading Style Sheets, and different ways to add
images and forms to your site.

Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
Part III gives you a ton of ways to make your site work, look, and sound great.
This part demystifies JavaScript and DHTML (Dynamic HTML), then it covers
the different ways that you add new features like blogs to your Web site and
shows you where to get great multimedia.

Building a Web Site For Dummies, 4th Edition

Part IV: Making Money
Part IV takes a look at making money from your site. It explodes the myths
about Internet income and shows you how to really make a profit, how to get
a credit card merchant account, and how to work both ends of the affiliates
game.

Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V is The Part of Tens. Well, it just wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without
The Part of Tens at the end, right? This part comprises three chapters, so you’ve
got 30 extra bits here that tell you all sorts of wonderful things, like where to go
for Web-site design advice and ways to add value to your site.
Finally, at the end of the book is a glossary of all the tech terms that might
otherwise leave you baffled.

Icons Used in This Book
The icons in the margins of this book point out items of special interest. Keep
an eye out for them — they’re important.
Psst! Listen, pal, I wouldn’t tell just anybody about this, but here’s a way to
make things a bit easier or get a little bit more out of it.

Time to tiptoe on eggshells. Make one false step, and things can get pretty
messy.

You don’t really need to know this stuff, but I just like to show off sometimes.
Humor me.

Well, of course, it’s all memorable material. But these bits are ones you’ll especially want to keep in mind.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
Well, keep turning pages, of course. And use the material to make your own
Web site the hottest thing there ever was.
One of the hardest parts about getting this book together was categorizing
the material in it. Many times, a Web site add-in could’ve been slotted into a
different chapter than the one it ended up in because it had multiple features
or attributes. So when you’re visiting any of the sites that I mention in this
book, be sure to take a good look around. A site that has a great chat room
might also have a fine affiliates program. One that offers a good series of Java
applets could have some solid tutorials on Web design. A site that has good
information on dedicated servers may have the best e-commerce solution for
you. I encourage you to browse up a storm.
Additionally, you can go to this book’s companion Web site, at www.dummies.
com/go/buildingawebsite4efd, where you can find links to many of the
sites discussed in the book.

start off by covering all the things you need to know
to put together a Web site. Chapter 1 shows you the
differences between a random bunch of Web pages and a
coherent Web site, while Chapter 2 is a quick refresher
course in basic HTML. Chapter 3 goes into some more
advanced areas like tables. Chapter 4 shows you how to
use a WYSIWYG editor to visually design your pages.
Finally, Chapter 5 gives you everything you need to know
about different Web-hosting options.

Planning for Good Site Design
In This Chapter
▶ Determining your site’s purpose
▶ Analyzing the audience
▶ Appealing to visitors
▶ Keeping your site lean

P

eople argue about what the number-one factor in quality Web site
design is, and they probably always will. Some say great graphics are
the key. Others say worthwhile information is everything. Still others think
that ease of use is the most important factor. I’m not so sure that there’s
such a thing as a linear ranking for these kinds of things. After all, a goodlooking site that doesn’t work well is useless. A site with a combination of
good content and lousy graphics is nothing to crow about either. This book
shows you how to do it all and how it all fits together to make a Web site
that’s actually worth visiting. If you want to get the basics of Web page structure down pat, check out Chapters 2 and 3 on HTML; for the lowdown on
graphic design, make sure you spend some time with Chapter 7.
In this chapter, I walk you through the fundamental things you should consider
as you create your Web site. And at the end of the chapter, I give you four
basic rules for creating Web sites that work. Take ’em with a grain of salt —
remember, you’re the ultimate judge.

Drafting a Plan
Are you publicizing a political candidate? Trumpeting your favorite cause?
Looking for a job? Selling shoe polish? Notice the verbs in each example.
They’re the key factors in determining your site’s purpose, as opposed to its
topic.

10

Part I: Building Your First Web Site

What do you want to accomplish?
Just having a topic isn’t enough — you need a purpose, too. The topic is merely
what the site is about; the purpose is what the site does. Say, for example, that
you want to create a site about penguins. Okay, that’s a nice starting point.
You like penguins — they’re cute, unusual, and pretty interesting; many people
share your interest in them. But why do you want to create a Web site about
them? Do you have something to say? Do you have information to give, an
opinion to share, or a particular point of view that you want to put across?
You don’t need to have a PhD in aquatic ornithology to create such a site.
Maybe you just like funny-looking birds that swim. But you still need a purpose, or the site just won’t work out in the long run. Perhaps you spent ages
plowing through the search engines, and you’ve gathered together the world’s
greatest collection of penguin links. But why did you go to all that trouble?
What’s your purpose?
If the purpose for creating a penguin site is for your own personal enjoyment,
you really don’t need to do much with the site. In fact, you can just create a
Web page on your own hard drive or even settle for leaving the links in your
Web browser’s bookmarks. If you do want your page on the World Wide Web,
however, you need to take into account the needs of your potential visitors,
as well as your own needs for creating such a site.
Suppose you’re putting your penguin page on the Web for the purpose of
sharing everything you know about these birds with the world. How does
that purpose change your approach to site design? You need to include more
on the Web site than a bare list of links, for one thing. Everything you do with
the site must help people understand its purpose. If you’re setting up your
own domain name, for example, you want to pick one that clearly describes
your site’s content — such as www.penguinfacts.com. (Grab it quick — it
still wasn’t taken at press time.)
The purpose of your site trickles down through each step you take in creating it. You want the title of each page in the site to specify how it supports
the site’s purpose. The textual content of each page needs to lead naturally
into some specific aspect of the topic that furthers your goal. Each graphical
image must be just the right one to drive home or emphasize a critical point.

Who do you want to reach?
Who are the people you expect to visit your site? What geographical or cultural groups do you want the site to appeal to? Without at least a general idea
of your potential audience, you can’t have much of an idea about what type
of site to create.

Chapter 1: Planning for Good Site Design
If data is available about the audience for similar sites, you want to track
it down. But where do you find it? Surprisingly, most of it’s available from
the people you’re competing with. (Even if you’re not running a commercial
site, similar sites are your competitors.) Anyone who’s been involved in any
type of corporate intelligence work would be shocked at the way people on
the World Wide Web casually throw around valuable information, instead of
keeping it under lock and key.
Many sites offer links to their visitor data. Even a quick perusal of the server
logs (which automatically record information about visitors) can provide
you with priceless insights into the sort of people who visit sites similar to
the one you’re creating. If the sites you want information on don’t list links
to their log data, send an e-mail message to the Webmaster asking how to
access it. Most Webmasters aren’t the slightest bit security-conscious about
their customer data, and you may be surprised at how many of them are
more than willing to spill the beans about their visitors.

Keeping your site fresh
If your material never changes, the odds are pretty good that most people
won’t come back to it very often, if ever. Unless your sole topic is a rock-solid
reference subject, you can’t get away with anything less than constant updating. Sure, the Oxford English Dictionary can come out with a new edition only
every few generations. (The first edition came out in 1928 and the second
one in 1989, with only two supplements in between.) But such cases are very
rare. Even if you deal with a modern high-tech equivalent, such as a site on
the Java programming language or the current HTML standard, you need to
stay on your toes.
If your core material is something that doesn’t change often, you need to add
some peripheral material that you can replace more frequently. Consider
adding a Tip of the Day, fresh links, a Did You Know? column, or something
along those lines so you can avoid offering only stale content to your return
visitors.
How often you need to update your site depends partially on your topic and
partially on your site policy. With sites that deal with volatile topics such
as breaking international news, you need to update on an hourly basis at a
minimum. On the other hand, sites that analyze the news can stand a more
leisurely pace — daily, weekly, or even monthly — because their scope is
considerably wider.
Even if your topic doesn’t absolutely demand a certain update schedule, you
should still establish a regular policy for how often you add fresh material
to your site. Whatever schedule you establish, make sure you stick with it.

11

12

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
Remember the comfort factor and bear in mind that your site’s visitors will
be less comfortable if they don’t know what to expect from you. Consistency
on your side helps build trust on theirs.
A Web site must change at least once a month to keep visitors interested in
coming back to it.

User-generated content
When the World Wide Web first got started, it was pretty much a one-way
street — Webmasters like you always made the decisions about what would
appear and how it could be used. As the Web has evolved, however, it has
taken on some important new characteristics.
Today, some of the Web’s most popular sites aren’t so much controlled by
their Webmasters as they are by their users. Places like YouTube and MySpace
are hotbeds for the users’ self-expression — and, indeed, that is their reason
for existence. The new trend that has led to the phrase “Web 2.0” is usergenerated content, supplemented by social networking.
Of course, the majority of Web sites are still generated almost totally by either
individuals or small teams working together, but the public’s hunger for its own
chance to shine is seemingly insatiable — and it’s something you might want to
keep in mind as you design your own Web site. Wikipedia and the other wikis
are collaborative efforts, and the old personal home page has largely given way
to blogs — Web logs, or personalized diaries that can be syndicated and sent to
others automatically. (See Chapter 12 for more information on blogs.)

Designing the Look of Your Site
All great art depends on having every necessary component in place and
nothing — not one thing — that you don’t need there. Great literature doesn’t
add extraneous characters or pad its plot lines. Great paintings don’t have
extra brush strokes or colors thrown in for no particular reason. When you’re
practicing the art of Web design, strive for that kind of purity.

Appealing to your audience
The audience — which is made up of the visitors you hope to attract to your
site — determines the content. To set some basic limits, think of these visitors as being at a beginning, an intermediate, or an advanced level, and gauge
your content accordingly. If you’re aiming advanced content at a beginning
audience or vice versa, you’re looking at failure from the word go.

Chapter 1: Planning for Good Site Design
Not only does your audience determine your content, but its preferences
influence your visual-design requirements as well. If your audience consists of
high-school students whose interests revolve mainly around the latest musical
sensations, you need a far different look from what you’d shoot for if it consists
of retired naval officers who want to know about international events.
For the young music lovers, for example, you need to strike a tone that’s
lighthearted and exciting, both in your words and graphics. Brighter colors
and a more relaxed and informal tone for the text are the call here. For the
old salts, though, you need to take a heavier approach, with darker, duller
colors and a middling-formal approach to language.
Whatever the group you’re aiming for, ask yourself the following questions:
✓ How do they communicate with one another? Roller-hockey players
don’t communicate quite the same way as cartographers do. What are
the level and style of language usage in the group? Do its members have
a particular jargon, slang, or regional dialect? If so, can you use it comfortably and correctly?
✓ What kind and color of clothes do they wear? This kind of information tells you volumes about their preferences. People who are willing
to wear suits and ties in midsummer don’t think the same way as those
who prefer casual clothing. The colors they wear also indicate the color
ranges they’re likely to feel comfortable with on your site.
✓ What’s their worldview? For many people, the world consists of their
apartment or house; the road between it and their workplace; their cubicle, office, or factory floor; and a couple of restaurants somewhere along
that pathway. For others, the world consists only of Wall Street and the
Asian financial markets. For some, the world is a series of airports, cell
phones, and e-mail messages. Anything that exists outside your audience’s worldview is invisible to them and probably doesn’t belong on
your Web site.
Find out all that you can — from what kind of cars your visitors drive to the
hours they wake and sleep. Any kind of information you can nail down about
your visitors and their lives helps you to understand them — and that understanding can’t help but improve your site’s appeal.

Avoiding clutter
If you’re one of those people who keeps a perfectly clean desk where your
speakers line up exactly perpendicular to the edge of your monitor, whose
laundry basket is more than occasionally empty, and who always knows
where to find everything you own, I probably can’t tell you much about organization. If you’re like the rest of us, however, read on.

13

14

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
Far too many Webmasters seem to think that the best kind of Web page is
one that has everything in the world crammed into it. It’s like a novel that
introduces 27 characters in the first two pages — the overkill ruins it, and
your mind is left swimming.
Perhaps you absolutely must put together a Web page containing a dozen
frames, several JavaScript pop-ups, numerous Java applets running in the
background, and a bunch of animated GIFs that move around the screen by
using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) positioning. If so, please, please, don’t put
in an image map, too.
The line between losing and winning is very fine if you’re considering using
Web gadgetry. Without it, most sites seem a bit on the dull side, and Web
designers exhibit a really strong keep-up-with-the-Joneses streak that usually
results in a frenzy of site changes whenever some new technique becomes
popular. Too much of a good thing — or too many good things in one place —
can, however, become a real problem.
The key is to remember your site’s purpose as you’re designing any page. If
anything you’re considering adding to the page doesn’t serve that purpose,
don’t add it. If you discover some fun or glitzy gizmo that you simply must
put on a page — and I show you plenty in this book to tempt you — first
determine if you can make it fit in with what you already have on that page. If
you absolutely can’t fit it in, but you still want to add it, maybe you can take
something else out to make room for it.
This doesn’t mean you can’t have more than one unusual feature on a page —
just make sure that you follow a path of moderation.

Achieving Usability
Usability is an important word for Web designers. It means just what it says —
making a site usable. Without usability, nothing else you do matters. What good
is it to have wonderful content if nobody can find it? What good is it to have
beautiful graphics on a page that is inaccessible except by dumb luck?
Fortunately, designing a usable Web site isn’t difficult, and following a few
simple rules can set you on your way. As with any set of rules, you may want
to break these from time to time, but you do so at your own peril:
✓ Keep your navigation system consistent on all the pages in your Web
site. If you have a link to your home page at the top of half your pages and
you put that link at the bottom of the rest, you’ll confuse your visitors.
✓ Put links to your home page and your search function on both the top
and bottom of every page. Too many Web designers put them on only
the top or the bottom, forcing users to scroll to find them. Don’t make
your visitors do extra work.

Chapter 1: Planning for Good Site Design
✓ Never use blue, underlined text for anything but a link. In fact, try
to avoid underlining at all. Use bold or italics for emphasis instead;
otherwise you’ll fool a lot of people into clicking underlined text to
no effect.
✓ Don’t use too many links in a navigation bar. Half a dozen is about the
most you should add. Remember that a navigation bar is not a site map,
but a guide to the major sections within your site.
✓ Use words! Using graphical icons may make your pages prettier, but
you should design your navigation bar (or whatever alternative you
use) to instantly communicate what it means to someone who has never
been to your site before. In this case, a picture is not worth a thousand
words.
✓ If your site is composed of hierarchical pages (and most of them are),
consider using breadcrumb navigation. The term comes from the idea
of leaving a trail of breadcrumbs as you walk so you can easily retrace
your steps. When applied to a Web site, the metaphor refers to a listing
at the top of the page showing the current page’s relationship to the
hierarchy; most often, these breadcrumbs are links that you can click to
go directly back to any place along the trail.

The Big Rules for Planning Your Site
Here are some short rules to condense the information in this chapter down
to a few rules that I think are pretty good guidelines, going by my own experience as both designer and visitor. Make these rules a part of your very being.
Do them in calligraphy and hang them on your wall. Use a wood-burning kit
to engrave them on your desk. Tattoo them backward on your forehead so
you see them in the mirror every morning.
✓ Rule #1: The Web is for reaching out to people.
✓ Rule #2: Keep your Web pages lean and clean.
✓ Rule #3: Know who your visitors are and what they want.
Remember that design and content are more a matter of art than science, which means that your own gut feelings count more than anything
else. If someone tells you that your design decisions are wrong, and that
person is someone whose input you respect, you certainly want to give
that opinion some consideration. But if you’re firmly convinced that
you’re right, never let anyone else’s concepts override your own. This
brings me to The Big Rule:
✓ Rule #4: It’s your Web site. It’s your vision. Do it your way.

Creating a Web Page
with Basic HTML Tags
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a look at tags
▶ Using HTML tags to format text
▶ Getting the lowdown on links
▶ Adding graphics to your Web site

T

his chapter’s here just in case you need a refresher on basic Web page
building before plunging ahead into all the wonderful stuff that’s covered
in the rest of the book. Here I touch on how you use HTML to create Web
pages — and populate those pages with text and images. I show you how to
format text, set the colors on your Web page, and set up links between pages
with both text and images.
Even if you already know all about these things, you may want to browse
through the chapter and check out some of the Web sites listed in the tables.

Tagging Along with HTML
Web pages are built primarily by writing instructions in HyperText Markup
Language (HTML). HTML is a simple language that tells a computer how to
create a document; its main aim is to tell a Web browser, such as Firefox or
Microsoft Internet Explorer, how a Web page should look on-screen. Happily,
there’s nothing really complex about HTML: The files you create are just
plain old text files and you don’t need anything more complex than Notepad
or any other simple text editor to create them. What I cover in this chapter is
the bare minimum that you need to know to create Web pages and link them
to make a Web site. If you’re interested in going deeper into HTML, check
out HTML, XHTML & CSS For Dummies by Ed Tittel and Jeff Noble (Wiley
Publishing).

18

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
You can find the HTML 4.01 specification at www.w3.org/TR/html401.
HTML is composed of elements. A paragraph or an image, for example, is
an element. Elements, in turn, are composed of tags, attributes, and —
sometimes — content. Here’s a little more information about each of those:
✓ Tags: A tag is a simple descriptive term that tells a Web browser what
element it’s dealing with.
• Start tag: The beginning of each element is shown by the name of
that element within angle braces; this is called a start tag. The start
tag for a paragraph, for example, is <P>; for an image, it’s <IMG>.
• End tag: The end of an element is shown by the end tag, which is
just like the start tag except that the end tag has a slash before the
element’s name. The end tag for a paragraph, therefore, is </P>.
Some elements, such as IMG, don’t have end tags.
✓ Attributes: An attribute is a modification of the basic element. You specify the width and height of an image, for example, by adding attributes to
the tag, as in the following example:
<IMG width=”100” height=”30”>
✓ Content: Content is anything that goes between the start tag and the
end tag, as in the following example:
<P>This is the content of this paragraph.</P>
The tags and attributes you need most often are covered in more depth in the
rest of this chapter, but the basics I just covered help you to understand
the choices you face among different Web page-building programs.
A typical Web page features a basic structure of three elements: HTML, HEAD,
and BODY. The HTML element contains both the HEAD and BODY elements, as
the following example demonstrates:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
</BODY>
</HTML>
You can make a Web page without using the HTML, HEAD, and BODY tags, but
I don’t recommend it. It’s technically possible, and even legitimate under the
HTML standard. But leaving them out can’t help anything, and putting them in
helps you to keep the other elements in their proper places.

Chapter 2: Creating a Web Page with Basic HTML Tags
All the code for everything that’s visible on the Web page goes into the BODY
element. The HEAD element contains information such as the page’s title,
which goes between the <TITLE> and </TITLE> tags like this:
<HEAD>
<TITLE>This is the page title.</TITLE>
</HEAD>
The title doesn’t appear on the actual Web page — it’s displayed in the title
bar at the top of the visitor’s Web browser.

Getting Wordy
Words are the foremost method of communication on the World Wide Web, and
it’s a rare Web page indeed that hasn’t got a passel of ’em scattered all over it.
In the examples provided in the following sections, I show the basic code
necessary for creating the particular elements (all made of words) that I talk
about (using a few more words).

Paragraphs
Paragraph elements are what you normally use to place text on a Web page.
You put the text between the <P> and </P> tags, as in the following example:
<P>This is where the textual content goes.</P>
Technically, the end tag for a P element is optional in HTML. You don’t need to
include it, although most Web-page creation programs add it automatically.
Web browsers add a bit of space between paragraphs automatically. If you
want some extra space, you can add it by using the line break, or BR, element, as the following example shows:
<P>This is the first paragraph.</P>
<BR>
<P>This paragraph has a space above it.</P>
Figure 2-1 shows the results of using the BR element.
You can usually get away with using an empty P element — one with no content between the start and end tags — to create a blank line between paragraphs instead of using a BR element. Unfortunately, this technique doesn’t
work for all Web browsers. Because empty P elements aren’t allowed under
the HTML standard, browsers that strictly follow the standard ignore them
and don’t insert a blank line.

19

20

Part I: Building Your First Web Site

Figure 2-1:
Paragraphs

white space
to your
Web page.

The standard solution to this problem is to put some invisible content into
the P element. Because Web browsers ignore plain white space, you can’t
just press your spacebar. Just put in a nonbreaking space with a special code
&nbsp;. Here’s how you do it:
<P>This is the first paragraph.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This paragraph has a space above it.</P>
If you use a nonbreaking space, make sure that you include the semicolon at
the end. If you don’t, you end up with the characters &nbsp on-screen rather
than a blank space.

Headings
Headings are also elements that contain text. Different headings create different sizes of text and make that text bold. HTML uses half a dozen heading
elements, ranging from the humongous H1 size all the way down to the teenyweeny H6. (You can probably guess that H2, H3, H4, and H5 are between H1
and H6 in size, so I won’t bother to explain that.)

Chapter 2: Creating a Web Page with Basic HTML Tags
You use headings to differentiate one section of text from another. Smaller
headings designate subsections under larger headings. Say, for example,
that you’re running a news Web site. You use H1 for the main headline and
follow it with the text in P elements. Any subheads in the article use H2 headings, any subheads under those headings use H3, and so on, as the following
example demonstrates:
<H1>Clown Runs Amok</H1>
<P>In a surprising development today, Clown of the Year
Toby O’Dell-Gonzalez went on a rampage through the
Hideyoshi Circus, spraying at least 17 elephants with
whipped cream.</P>
<H2>Echoes Earlier Incident</H2>
<P>Highly placed sources within the circus confirm that
this is not the first time the famed performer has
committed such an act. “Toby just kind of has a thing
about dairy products,” said one of the co-owners of the
circus.</P>
Figure 2-2 shows how the preceding code listing looks on your Web page.

Part I: Building Your First Web Site

Fonts
Font is a fancy term that describes the way a letter is shaped. This word is in
a font that’s different from the font this word is in. You can just go with the
default fonts — those fonts that are set automatically in the Web browser —
or you can specify which fonts you want. For casual Web-page development,
the default fonts work just fine, but you may prefer to make your own choices
to get just the right look.
Two elements that you use most often for altering fonts are B and I. These
elements set the enclosed lettering to bold or italic print, respectively, as in
the following example:
<P>This is normal print. <B>This is bold print.</B>
<I>This is italicized print.</I></P>
You can also use the FONT element to set the face of the text, which is the
basic appearance of the lettering (whether it’s Arial, Times New Roman, and
so on), as well as the size and color. (See the section “Using Color,” later in
this chapter, for more information on setting color.) The following example
shows how to use the FONT element to set face, size, and color:
<P><FONT face=”Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif” size=”5”
color=”blue”>This is blue-colored Helvetica in
size 5.</FONT>
<FONT face=”Times New Roman, Times, serif” size=”3”
color=”red”>This is red-colored Times Roman in
size 3.</FONT>
<FONT face=”Courier New, Courier, mono” size=”7”
color=”black”>This is black-colored Courier in
size 7.</FONT></P>
Figure 2-3 shows the results of the two preceding code examples.
Although I used the FONT element on whole sentences in the code example,
you can also apply it to smaller stretches of text — even to a single character.
The reason for the face attribute’s several choices is that many different
computer systems are hooked up to the Internet, and Windows doesn’t offer
the same options that Macs or Unix systemsdo. If the font you specify isn’t
available, the visitor’s Web browser makes its best guess about what font
to substitute. By offering a series of font options for the browser to use, you
improve the chances of a visitor seeing just what you intended. The preceding code example includes all you need to cover the three main types of font
faces common on the World Wide Web.

Lines
Okay, a horizontal line isn’t really a word, but this part of the book is the
least unlikely place I can think of to discuss this element. In HTML, these
lines are technically known as horizontal rules, so the element that represents them is called HR. Horizontal rules separate one section of a page from
another visually, underline an image, and do just about anything you normally do with lines.
You can set the width of horizontal rules as either a percentage of the width
of the screen or as an exact pixel value. The default width value of a horizontal line is 100 percent of the screen width, so if you don’t specify the value of
the width attribute, that’s what you get. To specify a width of 50 percent, for
example, use the following code:
<HR width=”50%”>
To specify a width of 400 pixels, you do it like this instead:
<HR width=”400”>

23

24

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
You use the size attribute to set the height, or thickness, of the line, as the
following example shows:
<HR size=”6”>
By default, the line is hollow, or shaded. (The hollow line is called shaded
because back in the days when Web pages weren’t so colorful and all you had
to work with was black text on a medium-gray background, hollow horizontal
lines appeared to sink into the page, creating a shaded, or 2-D, effect. Against
most other background colors, the effect isn’t apparent.) To make a line
solid, you need to add the noshade attribute, as in the following example:
<HR noshade>
The following code creates the Web page shown in Figure 2-4:
<HR>
<HR width=”100%”>
<HR width=”50%”>
<HR width=”200”>
<HR width=”400”>
<HR size=”10”>
<HR size=”6” noshade>

Chapter 2: Creating a Web Page with Basic HTML Tags
Many Web designers use graphics (such as GIF files) to create horizontal lines
instead of relying on HTML. See the clip-art sources in the section “Picturing
It: Using Images,” later in this chapter, for some examples.

Using Color
Unless you’re really into television reruns or artsy photography, you probably don’t see much of anything in black and white these days. The world’s a
colorful place, and you may disappoint your visitors if you don’t use color on
your Web site.
I touch on color in the earlier section “Fonts,” but you can use color in many
places. As time goes by, you will doubtlessly be able to color every element
in HTML.
If you use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), you have much more control over
color than you do with normal HTML. There’s an introduction to CSS in
Chapter 6 of this book, and you can find out even more in the book Creating
Web Sites Bible, by Philip Crowder and yours truly (Wiley Publishing).
If you read the “Fonts” section earlier in this chapter, you already know that
you can set the color of a particular set of letters, but you can also set the
base color for all the text — as well as for a page’s background and its links.
The links use three different colors: one for links a visitor hasn’t clicked, one
for links that he or she is clicking, and one for links already visited.
You can accomplish all these color changes by setting the values for various
attributes of the BODY element:
✓ text — Text color
✓ bgcolor — Background color
✓ link — Unvisited link color
✓ vlink — Visited link color
✓ alink — Color for a link that someone’s clicking (the active link)
Setting all these attributes at once looks like this:
<BODY text=”black” bgcolor=”white” link=”blue” vlink=”red”
alink=”purple”>

Creating Links
When it comes to the World Wide Web, links (which connect different files) are
everything. Without them, the Web wouldn’t exist. You create links with the A
(anchor) element. That element’s href (hypertext reference) attribute gives the
Web address of the file you want to link to. This address is called a URL, which is
short for uniform resource locator. Here’s what a link looks like in HTML:
<A href=”http://www.dummies.com/”>content</A>
The part that reads content is where you put words or images that people
can click to go to the linked file. This content appears by default as blue
underlined letters (if it’s a text link) or as a blue outlined image (if it’s an
image link).

Picturing It: Using Images
You can have a Web page with nothing but words on it, but most people think
that’s a bit dull. It’s pretty rare to find a site that’s not filled with images of one
kind or another. When it comes to placing images on the World Wide Web,
you need to use graphics files in one of three common formats: GIF, JPEG (also
called JPG), or PNG. (Chapter 7 covers these file formats in more depth.)
Where do you get images? You can create them from scratch, or you can
download ready-to-use files from some of the Web sites listed in Table 2-1. If
you use other people’s images — as most Web designers do — be sure first
that you read all the fine print on their Web sites. Unless it states otherwise,
the original artist owns the copyright on an image — which means you can’t
use it without permission. Fortunately, the vast majority of artists on the
Web are eager to give that permission in exchange for nothing more than a
link from your Web site back to theirs. This arrangement gives them free publicity and gives you free, high-quality artwork. Everybody’s happy.
If the artist isn’t willing to let you display copyrighted art in exchange for a
link, you may have to pay to use the image. Sometimes, too, the image is free
to use on noncommercial sites but costs money to use on commercial ones. To
reemphasize the point, make sure that you read the fine print. Don’t — I repeat,
don’t — just grab an image that’s not free, use it, and figure that you can get
away with it. It’s possible, of course, to download any image you can see in a
Web browser — but you’re cheating the artist and running the risk of serious
repercussions — which can include federal charges. Plenty of freely available
art is out there. Stick with it, and you’re a lot less likely to run into problems.

Images
The most common item other than text on Web pages is the image, represented by the IMG element. The only absolutely required attribute for that
element is the src attribute, which specifies the name and — if the file is
located somewhere other than in the same directory as the HTML file that
links to it — the location of the graphics file.
Thus, you code the simplest image on a Web page (see Figure 2-5) like this:
<IMG src=”seated16.jpg”>
To specify a graphics file in another folder, you add the path to the folder, as
in the following example:
<IMG src=”pets/seated16.jpg”>
If the graphics file is on another Web server entirely, you add the full path to
that URL, as follows:
<IMG src=”http://www.anotherserver.com/seated16.jpg”>
I mention in the section “Creating Links,” earlier in this chapter, that you can
use an image as a link just as you can use text for one. To do so, just put the
IMG element right between the start and end tags for the A element, as the
following example shows:
<A href=”http://www.dummies.com/”><IMG src=”seated16.jpg”></A>

IMG elements don’t have an end tag.

Background images
A background image follows the same rules as a regular image, except that
you create it by using the background attribute of the BODY element rather
than an IMG element, as shown in the following example:
<BODY background=”guitar2.jpg”>
Background images tile, which means they repeat themselves across the
page until they reach the edge of the screen. Then they begin tiling again in
the next available space below the first line of images, and so on, until they
fill the entire page from side to side and top to bottom. Because of this characteristic, most people prefer to use small background images, such as the
guitars shown in Figure 2-6.
Choose background images with care. Make sure they don’t interfere with the
other elements on the Web page. You want the color muted, the lines indistinct, and the content supportive of the overall theme.

Putting It All Together
Okay, so you’ve seen the kinds of elements you use on a Web page. Now it’s
time to actually build a page from them. Of course, you’ll probably never use
every possibility, as some combinations would create design conflicts (if you
use both a background color and a background image, for example, you’ll
never see the background color because the background image would cover
it), but this example shows you how the elements fit together on a typical
Web page:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>This is the page title.</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY text=”black” bgcolor=”white” link=”blue” vlink=”red”
alink=”purple”>

▶ Working with framesets and frames
▶ Setting borders and margins

A

Web page doesn’t have to be just a straightforward run of text and
images from top to bottom. In this chapter, I show you some simple
tricks you can use to add structure to your Web pages.
What you see on the screen isn’t always what it looks like on the surface
because savvy Web designers know that adding an internal skeleton adds
strength to their efforts. The most common way to do that is to make your
whole Web page into a table, a series of neatly aligned boxes into which you
slot the components of your page. You can leave all the “bones” showing or,
for a more elegant appearance, make them all invisible — that way, you get
all the benefit of the underlying structure with none of the clutter usually
associated with tables.
Frames can also be used for similar effect. Each frame is an entirely separate
Web page with its own source code, yet, when you use frames, all these Web
pages are displayed simultaneously on the same screen as if they were all
from a single source.

Creating Tables
Over the course of your life you’ve seen tables used to structure information
a zillion times. Usually they’re nothing more than a blocky listing of some
sort of data. On the Web, though, tables can be a whole lot more.

32

Part I: Building Your First Web Site

Defining rows and columns
Web tables, like normal ones, appear to be composed of rows and columns.
In Web design, however, you only deal with the rows (horizontal areas). As
you might expect, you start things off with a TABLE element. This contains
a series of TR (table row) elements which contain some TD (table data)
elements, or cells.
Here’s an example of the coding for a simple table:
<TABLE border=”1”>
<TR>
<TD>Cell One</TD>
<TD>Cell Two</TD>
<TD>Cell Three</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Cell Four</TD>
<TD>Cell Five</TD>
<TD>Cell Six</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Cell Seven</TD>
<TD>Cell Eight</TD>
<TD>Cell Nine</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

Figure 3-1 shows how this looks in a Web browser.
In this example, the width of the border, or the lines surrounding it, is set to
a single pixel.
If you set a value of “0” for the border, there won’t be any lines around the
table. This can be an important factor in your design because it enables you
to use the structure of a table for formatting purposes without allowing the
lines to intrude. Generally speaking, tables look best with border values
between 1 and 4.

Setting table dimensions
You can set the size of a table by using the width and height attributes,
specifying a measure either in pixels or as a percentage of the screen size.
This example would set the size to 600 by 300 pixels:
<TABLE width=”600” height=”300”>

Chapter 3: Arranging Your Text with Tables and Other Advanced Tags

Figure 3-1:
A simple
table.

To specify that the table should take up all the available space on the screen,
you’d use this code instead:
<TABLE width=”100%” height=”100%”>

You also have the flexibility to mix the two approaches if your design requires
you to do so. You could, for example, set a table so it would stretch across
the entire screen from side to side, while restricting its height to 400 pixels,
by using this code:
<TABLE width=”100%” height=”400”>

You don’t have to set both the width and the height. It’s perfectly okay to
specify one but not the other.

Defining cell sizes
Although the overall size of the table is an important consideration, of
course, the greatest power for a Web designer comes from specifying the
size of individual cells.
There are, as you might imagine, some tradeoffs you have to consider
because the cells are contained within the table — therefore their settings

33

34

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
can adversely affect the layout if handled incorrectly. The main thing to keep
in mind is that setting height and width often affects more than one cell:
✓ If you set the height of one cell (TD), then every cell in that row (TR) will
be set to that height. If you set heights for more than one cell in a row,
the lower height values will be ignored and the greatest height will be
applied to the entire row. With height, keep in mind that you’re dealing
with rows, not with columns — so the cells above and below the one
whose height you set will remain unaffected.
✓ If you’re setting width, all cells in the column will be set to the width
you specify. Although there’s no such thing as a “column element,” this
effect is intended to promote symmetry in the table. If you need varying cell widths in a single column, there’s a way around this; see the
“Spanning rows and columns” section later in this chapter for details.
Another potential “gotcha” when you’re tinkering with cell sizes is the use
of percentages. There’s a big difference between setting cell size and setting
table size: With a table, you’re dealing with a percentage of the browser’s
screen size; with a cell, you’re specifying a percentage of the table’s size.
Let’s say you have a table that has (as in the earlier example) a width of 600
pixels. When you specify a cell width that’s 10% of that, you’re setting that
cell to be 60 pixels wide rather than 10% of the total screen width. If, on the
other hand, you have a table set to be 80% of the screen width, then a cell set
to 10% will be one tenth of that — 8% of the screen width.
Okay, so much for theory; let’s get down to some actual coding. The following code sets the height of the first cell (TD element) to 100 pixels and the
width of the fifth cell (the second one in the second row) to 200 pixels; the
ninth one (the last one in the last row) has a width of 300 pixels:
<TABLE border=”1” width=”100%”>
<TR>
<TD height=”100”>Cell One</TD>
<TD>Cell Two</TD>
<TD>Cell Three</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Cell Four</TD>
<TD width=”200”>Cell Five</TD>
<TD>Cell Six</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Cell Seven</TD>
<TD>Cell Eight</TD>
<TD width=”300”>Cell Nine</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

Figure 3-2 shows this in action.

Chapter 3: Arranging Your Text with Tables and Other Advanced Tags

Figure 3-2:
Setting cell
sizes.

Padding and spacing cells
If you just go with default settings and don’t specify any space adjustments,
then every cell will be right up against its neighboring cells and any content
you put in your cells will be flush with the edges of the cell. Depending upon
your particular design requirements, this can be either good or bad.
You have control over these factors via the cellspacing and cellpadding
attributes. Cell spacing refers to the amount of space between the cells themselves, whereas cell padding controls the space between the cell’s edges and
the cell’s contents.
Cell padding can be especially important when you’ve set the table’s border to
“0” so that no lines show.
The following example creates three tables with cell-spacing values of 5, 10,
and 20, respectively:
<TABLE border=”1” cellspacing=”5”>
<TR>
<TD>Cell One</TD>
<TD>Cell Two</TD>
<TD>Cell Three</TD>
</TR>

</TR>
</TABLE>

Figure 3-3 shows the results.

Cell padding, as mentioned before, sets the distance between the content of
a cell and the cell’s border. This can be a very important factor, especially
when you’re dealing with text. Of course, other factors are involved as well;
for details, see the “Playing with alignments” section later in this chapter.
To set the amount of space — again, in pixels — between a cell’s content and
its borders, you simply need to specify it via the cellpadding attribute. The
following example creates three tables with cell padding settings of 5, 10, and
20, respectively:
<TABLE border=”1” cellpadding=”5”>
<TR>
<TD>Cell One</TD>
<TD>Cell Two</TD>
<TD>Cell Three</TD>

<TR>
<TD>Cell Seven</TD>
<TD>Cell Eight</TD>
<TD>Cell Nine</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

Figure 3-4 shows the results.
The cellspacing and cellpadding attributes affect the entire table; they
cannot be set for individual rows.

Spanning rows and columns
Here’s where things get really interesting. Your Web tables don’t have to be
just equal-size rectangles running up and down and right and left. With row
and column spanning, you can alter the whole structure of a table to suit
your needs.

Chapter 3: Arranging Your Text with Tables and Other Advanced Tags

Figure 3-4:
Varying cell
padding.

The colspan and rowspan attributes are applied to individual cells (TD elements). In a data-presentation scenario, this technique is most commonly used
for presenting category titles or headings, as shown in the following example:
<TABLE border=”1”>
<TR>
<TD rowspan=”2”></TD>
<TD colspan=”2”>Title One</TD>
<TD colspan=”2”>Title Two</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Subhead One</TD>
<TD>Subhead Two</TD>
<TD>Subhead Three</TD>
<TD>Subhead Four</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD rowspan=”2”>
<P>Sidehead One<BR>
Sidehead Two</P>
<TD>Data One</TD>
<TD>Data Two</TD>
<TD>Data Three</TD>
<TD>Data Four</TD>
</TR>
<TR>

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
<TD>Data Five</TD>
<TD>Data Six</TD>
<TD>Data Seven</TD>
<TD>Data Eight</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

Figure 3-5 shows how this looks.
The <P> and <BR> tags in the preceding example illustrate a very important
point. Cells are kind of like miniature Web pages — they can contain anything
you can add via standard HTML — which means you can toss in links, images,
videos, or whatever suits your fancy.

Playing with alignments
Aligning a table is a fairly simple matter; you simply set the TABLE element’s
align attribute to left, center, or right. Using the align attribute with
the TR and TD elements, however, affects the contents of those elements
rather than the elements themselves.

Figure 3-5:
Using column and
row
spanning.

Chapter 3: Arranging Your Text with Tables and Other Advanced Tags
If you set a row (TR) to center alignment, then all the contents of all the cells
in that row are centered. If you set it to right alignment, then all the contents
align with the right margin of the cells, and so on. However, you can specify
different alignment values for each cell, and these override and value for the
row as a whole.
The alignment of a row (TR) or cell (TD) depends upon two attributes: the
align attribute for horizontal alignment (left, center, or right) and the
valign attribute for vertical alignment (top, middle, or bottom).
By default, if no alignment is set for a row, all of its contents are horizontally
left-aligned and vertically center-aligned.
The following example modifies the code from the previous example to specify different alignments:
<TABLE border=”1”>
<TR align=”right”>
<TD rowspan=”2”></TD>
<TD colspan=”2” align=”center”>Title One</TD>
<TD colspan=”2”>Title Two</TD>
</TR>
<TR height=”60” valign=”center”>
<TD valign=”top”>Subhead One</TD>
<TD valign=”bottom”>Subhead Two</TD>
<TD>Subhead Three</TD>
<TD>Subhead Four</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD rowspan=”2”>
<P>Sidehead One<BR>

<TD>Data One</TD>
<TD>Data Two</TD>
<TD>Data Three</TD>
<TD>Data Four</TD>

Using Frames and Framesets
The two basic kinds of Web page structures are regular and framed. Regular
gets better mileage on highways, and framed looks nice on a wall. Wait, no,
that’s something else. . . . Okay: A regular Web page is a stand-alone structure.
Frames, on the other hand, enable you to place more than one Web page onscreen at a time. To the visitor, a framed site appears as one coherent whole,
no different from a regular page. Frames give you more capabilities, such as
simultaneously showing many Web pages in a typical browser — and a few
extra headaches (such as making them work with search engines as well).

Building pages with frames and framesets
As mentioned in Chapter 2, Web pages are built with elements. A typical Web
page features a basic structure of three elements: HTML, HEAD, and BODY. The
HTML element contains both the HEAD and BODY elements, as the following
example demonstrates:

Chapter 3: Arranging Your Text with Tables and Other Advanced Tags
<HTML>
<HEAD>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
</BODY>
</HTML>
Framed sites work a bit differently from the way regular sites work: You build
them out of framesets, which set off different areas of the screen. Each area
contained within a frameset is known as a frame, and each frame contains its
own Web page. The following HTML code sets up the pair of frames that you
see in Figure 3-7:
<HTML>
<FRAMESET cols=”80,*”>
<FRAME name=”leftFrame” src=”navigation.html”>
<FRAME name=”mainFrame” src=”main.html”>
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

Figure 3-7:
Framed

to bring

from multiple files
onto one
screen.

43

44

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
The “80,*” in the preceding code listing means you’re setting aside 80 pixels
for the first frame, and the rest of the screen is available for the second frame.
You can also specify a specific pixel amount for the second frame if you want.
As with tables, you also have the option to specify a percentage of the screen
for each frame rather than exact pixel sizes, as in the following example:
<FRAMESET cols=”20%,*”>
To create horizontal frames instead of vertical frames, you use the rows
attribute instead of cols in the first frameset tag. Everything else works
just the same way.
The src attribute works sort of like that attribute does with images: It specifies the source of the file that will be displayed inside the frame. Here, though,
you’re giving the location of an entire HTML file.

Adding borders and margins to frames
As with tables, you can play with the borders and margins in your frames in
order to achieve your design goals.
By default, you have the kind of 3D borders between frames that appear in
Figure 3-7. To change these, you use — you guessed it — the border attribute, as shown in this example that sets the width to 5 pixels:
<FRAMESET cols=”80,*” border=”5”>
Figures 3-8 and 3-9 show the effect of border settings of a single pixel and
10 pixels.
Border colors (normally gray) can be specified using the bordercolor attribute. To modify the previous example so the borders are red, you’d do this:
<FRAMESET cols=”20%,*” border=”5” bordercolor=”red”>
You can set the amount of space between the edges of frames by specifying
a value via the marginheight and marginwidth attributes of the FRAME
element. Setting these values to “0” (zero) means that the contents of the
frames are loaded with no space between them. If you wanted, on the other
hand, to force an all-around margin of, say, 20 pixels, you’d do it like this:

W

YSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) programs are easy for
novices to use in the early stages of Web site creation, but they can
quickly prove less than satisfactory. The reason for both factors is the same:
The program makes a bunch of choices for you. Although this feature may
seem like a comfort at first, it can quickly become a limitation. If you go for
a WYSIWYG program, make sure that it’s sophisticated enough that you can
still use it as your skills advance.
Most WYSIWYG programs have at least some degree of depth beneath their
surface simplicity. The CoffeeCup HTML Editor (the topic of this chapter), for
example, lets you set the attributes for every element, in case you don’t like
the default choices. This gives you the best of both worlds, allowing you to
create visually while working under the hood with the base code. That means
you can enjoy both the quickness of WYSIWYG creation and the total control
of text editing in the same page-creation session.
CoffeeCup, shown in Figure 4-1, is the main choice of many professional Web
designers, though it isn’t the only one. You can pick up a copy at www.coffee
cup.com/html-editor (there’s a 28-day trial version and the full version goes
for $49). Table 4-1 lists several WYSIWYG programs you can use to build Web
pages, along with the Web addresses where you can find them (or information about them).

for building
Web pages.

Creating the Basic Page in CoffeeCup
After you understand what’s going on under the hood of a Web page, as discussed in the previous chapters, it’s time to sit back and let CoffeeCup do a
little magic for you.
Don’t worry about doing anything fancy here; I cover site design in other
chapters. For now, just play around with CoffeeCup and experience the joy
of working with a truly excellent program (one of my personal favorites,
seriously). In the next few sections, I walk you through using it to set page
properties and work with text and links. Of course, you should feel free to
experiment with different values, colors, and so on, as you familiarize yourself with the program.

Setting the page properties
In Chapter 2, I explain how to set the page title and page background with the
normal HTML approach. Here’s how to set page properties with CoffeeCup:

Chapter 4: Working with WYSIWYG
1. First, you need a page to work with. Click the New Blank Page button
in the opening screen (refer to Figure 4-1).
The Quick Start dialog box appears.
2. Enter a title in the Page Title text box.
This text will appear at the top of your visitors’ Web browser screens
when they visit your page.
3. If you want to add a background image, click the Browse button (the
little file folder with a green arrow) and then navigate to the image
file and select it.
4. If you want to change the background color, click the arrow to the
right of the Background color to open a drop-down palette, as shown
in Figure 4-2. Choose a color from the palette by clicking it.

Figure 4-2:
Set the colors for your
page in the
Quick Start
dialog box.

The color change is shown in the display area (see Figure 4-3).
If you have already set a background image, then the background color
won’t matter because the image covers it.
5. Similarly, to change the colors of the text or links, click the arrow next
to the appropriate color box and then choose a color from that palette.

49

50

Part I: Building Your First Web Site

Figure 4-3:
CoffeeCup
shows the
effects of
different
color settings as
you choose
them.

6. Generally speaking, you shouldn’t change the Advanced Settings such
as Doctype unless your Web page has unusual requirements such as a
need to use the Greek alphabet. However, you may want to enter your
keywords in the Meta Keywords text box (see Chapter 13 for more on
keywords).
If you want to add keywords later on, choose Insert➪Meta Keywords
from the menu.
7. Click the OK button to complete the process.

Working with text and links
A purely graphical Web page is, of course, something of an anomaly.
Generally speaking, most of any given page is made up of text. Any text that
leads to another Web page is said to be linked to the new page. (See Chapter
2 for more info on text and links.)

Modifying text
The Font button is the third one in the Code Editor’s menu bar. It has several
options that you can choose from, each of which changes the formatting of
your text (see Figure 4-4).

Chapter 4: Working with WYSIWYG

Figure 4-4:
The Font
button presents various
options.

When the Font button is clicked, these are the formatting options available:
✓ Font Wizard: To set the typeface (Arial, Courier, and so on), you need to
click the Font Wizard option. In the resulting dialog box (see Figure 4-5),
you can also specify the previously mentioned settings such as size.
✓ Font Sizes: Set the size of the font (1–7).
✓ Font Color: Select the text color.
✓ Font Effects: This option lets you choose options such as Bold and Italic.
✓ Header Sizes: Set the size of headers (H1–H6).

Adding links
To add a link, follow these steps:
1. Select the text you want to make into a link.
You can skip this step and enter the text in Step 3 if you haven’t typed it yet.
2. Click the Link button (the second one in the Code Editor’s menu bar)
and select Link (or simply use the Ctrl+L key combination).
In the resulting dialog box (shown in Figure 4-6), the selected text is displayed.
3. If no text was selected, you can enter it now in the Link Text box.

4. Enter the URL of the page you want to link to.
If you’ve linked to this file before, you can click the arrow to the right to
select it from a drop-down list. You can also click the Browse button to
navigate to the file.
5. If you don’t want the linked page to open in place of your page, then
choose the appropriate target (such as New Browser Window).
6. Optionally, enter text for a popup tooltip in the Title text box.
7. Optionally, enter text for a status-bar message (Internet Explorer only).
8. Click the OK button to complete the process.

Chapter 4: Working with WYSIWYG

Adding images
Adding images in CoffeeCup is much easier than typing all the information in
a text editor. Follow these steps to add images:
1. Click the Image button (the first one in the Code Editor’s menu bar) or
use the Ctrl+M key combination.
The Insert Image dialog box (shown in Figure 4-7) appears.
2. Navigate to the image.
The URL of the image file appears in the Image box.

Figure 4-7:
Choosing an
image.

3. Enter some alternate text (for non-visual browsers) in the Alt text box.
Alt text appears even if the image is unavailable.
4. Optionally, enter a title for the image in the Title text box.
5. You can specify the alignment of the image so that (for example) text
will flow around it.
6. If desired, set the width (in pixels) of a border that will appear around
the image.

53

54

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
7. If you want to resize the image, type the new height and width in the
appropriate text boxes.
8. If you want to make the image into a link, enter the URL or browse to
locate the file.
9. Click the OK button to finalize the image insertion.

Switching views
There are three ways to see the pages that you’re creating in CoffeeCup:
in the Code Editor (the actual HTML, XHTML, or whatever language you’re
using), in the Preview tab (the WYSIWYG view), or in a combination of
the two.
It’s an easy matter to switch among the views: In normal usage, simply
click the Code Editor or Preview tabs. To see both the code and its effect
without having to switch back and forth, press the F12 function key from
within the Code Editor. To go back to the regular Code view, press it again.
Figure 4-8 shows the Preview tab, and Figure 4-9 shows the Code and
Preview option.

Figure 4-8:
Preview tab.

Working with Website Projects
Of course, unless your site is a minimal one, you don’t just tinker with a page
here and a page there, but with the site as a whole. That’s where CoffeeCup’s
Website Project feature shines. Here’s how to use it:
1. Click the New Website Project button in the Welcome dialog box
(see Figure 4-10) when you first launch CoffeeCup. To get a new
project going if you’re already working in CoffeeCup, select My
Websites➪New Website Project from the menu.

Figure 4-10:
The
Welcome
dialog box.

55

56

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
2. In the Website Project Settings dialog box (shown in Figure 4-11),
enter a name for the new project.

Figure 4-11:
Entering
project settings.

3. In the Website Project Location text box, click the Browse button to
the right and navigate to the local folder you want to use as the root
for your Web site.
4. If you have a Web server ready, check with your tech-support people
to get the information you need to enter under the Server settings.
You can go ahead and build your site without having a Web server.
When you’re ready to go on the Web, just add this info.
5. Under File Upload, choose how you want CoffeeCup to handle dependent files (for example, included images) during uploads.
If you don’t select the Check Dependencies before Uploading Files check
box, then you can upload a page without regard to any dependent files.
You also have the option to specify whether to always upload dependent files (the default setting), never upload dependent files, or to have
CoffeeCup ask you what you want to do at upload time.
6. Click the OK button to finish.
From now on, all pages you create in this project will go into the folder you
selected, shown in the My Websites panel on the left side of the screen.

Letting the World In: Choosing a
Host and Domain Name
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing a host
▶ Finding free Web site providers
▶ Picking and registering domain names

I

f you don’t already have a Web site or if you’re unhappy with your current Web space provider, you have several options. You can run your own
Web server, of course. With any type of broadband connection and Linux,
it’s even possible to put together a creditable setup in your own home. But
that’s a lot of work — ask network administrators just how much leisure time
they have. And many broadband providers have policies forbidding you from
doing that sort of thing, anyway.
If you want to focus on developing and maintaining your site, your best bet is
to leave the day-to-day grunge work of keeping the server up and running to
someone else.

Practically every Web-hosting provider offers all sorts of extended services in
addition to plain Web space. These often include some form of e-commerce
hosting, ranging from simply supplying the software to setting up a complete
turnkey solution (“here’s your system — turn the key and you’re good to go”)
for you.

60

Part I: Building Your First Web Site

Going Live: Choosing a Host
You have three basic options when it comes to Web hosting:
✓ ISPs
✓ Virtual servers
✓ Dedicated servers

ISPs
The same people who provide you with Internet access can also be your Web
space provider. Almost certainly, you have at least some room for Web pages
as part of your basic service. If you’re not interested in a very extensive site
or in one that has tons of glitzy features, the basic setup the ISP gives you will
probably suffice. Even if you don’t have any kind of CGI access (see Chapter
8 for more on the Common Gateway Interface), you can probably still use
remotely hosted services, like the ones described in this book, to enhance
your site.
Many domain name registrars (described in “Finding a registrar,” later in this
chapter) also provide various amounts of Web site space as a part of their
services.

Virtual servers
Virtual servers are nothing more than directories on a hard drive. If that hard
drive is on an existing Web server that supports virtual server capabilities,
however, the Webmaster can make each one of those directories seem as
though it’s a fully functional Web server.
Other than being a really clever example of how you can use computer technology, does this have a practical application for you? It depends on your
budget and your site’s traffic expectations. It’s certainly one of the cheapest
ways to get your site up and running. You could pay for a couple of months’
worth of a typical virtual server by skipping one good dinner at a decent restaurant. Some virtual servers are so cheap that you could pay for them just
by skipping dessert.

Chapter 5: Letting the World In: Choosing a Host and Domain Name
On the other hand, you’re sharing one physical server with lots of other virtual servers. Any physical server’s performance degrades as it gets busier,
with more and more people connecting to it and placing demands on it. But
if you’re on a virtual server, that scenario has a slightly different meaning.
People visiting a Web site on one of the other virtual servers hosted on the
same physical server as yours are putting a drain on your resources, too,
because those resources are shared. Basically, if someone else’s site gets
too busy, yours can slow down till it looks like a turtle in molasses. And vice
versa.

Dedicated servers
Nearly every company that handles virtual servers also leases dedicated
ones. A dedicated server is a step up from a virtual server: Although it costs a
bit more, it’s your very own physical computer holding your Web site, with
nobody else on it.
Both virtual and dedicated servers offer more than just Web hosting. For
example, they also handle e-mail. The focus here is only on the Web-hosting
aspect because this book is about Web sites.
Dedicated servers used to cost a small fortune, but a combination of generally lower computer prices and competitive pressures has dropped the
expense of leasing one. At a rock-bottom price of around $50–$100 per
month, dedicated servers are still maybe a bit pricey for a private individual,
but for any serious commercial operation, they’re a great bargain. After all,
that’s only $600–$1,200 a year, although hiring a single network administrator to work at your company can easily set you back 100 times that or even
more.
Why compare those two costs? Aren’t they apples and oranges? No, not at
all. When you lease a dedicated server, the people you’re leasing it from take
care of keeping it up and running, which is what a network administrator
does. Like virtual servers, dedicated servers are located at the facility of a
Web space provider, such as Verio (www.verio.com — see Figure 5-1), and
you don’t have to worry about regularly backing up your data, restoring after
a crash, upgrading things like Linux kernels, or any of the million things that
keep technical staffs hopping.

Finding your match
You can always run through the standard search engines and site guides
looking for information on Web hosts. Some search engines, such as
HostIndex (www.hostindex.com), however, are specifically designed to
help you track down the right host for you (see Figure 5-2). The Web sites in
Table 5-1 will help you do some comparison shopping.

Keeping It Cheap: Free
Web-Site Providers
More than 23 zillion Web-space providers have an unbeatable price, which
you probably guessed already from the title of this section. If you set up a
personal or limited-interest site (such as a condo association’s newsletter),
free Web-space providers may be the way to go. You can get lots more space
than your local ISP provides. It’s not unusual to get 50 or more megabytes
(MB) of Web storage space without having to pay a dime for it.
If you plan on running any sort of professional site, though, the free Web
space providers aren’t really the ticket for you. You need your own domain
name — .com, .org, or whatever — in order to be taken seriously. (See the
section “Getting Your Own Domain Name,” later in this chapter.) Also, free
Web hosts make their money by slapping ads onto your site, and you can’t
usually put up your own ads in competition with them.

63

64

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
Having to post a free Web host’s ad on your site means you may not be able to
use any add-ins such as opinion polls and chat rooms that feature their own
banner ads.

Getting Your Own Domain Name
Domain names, such as dummies.com, are the addresses of sites on the
World Wide Web. Picking and registering your own domain name are two of
the most critical phases in your site planning; I show you how to do both in
this section. When you tell your Web browser to go to www.dummies.com,
it’s obvious where you’re going to end up — at the For Dummies Web site.
Your computer doesn’t know that, though. It can’t actually go to a named
site; instead, it asks a domain name server (DNS) to translate that name into
a more computer-friendly set of numbers known as an IP address. It’s like getting into a cab and telling the driver to go to the Acme Building. He asks you
where it is, and you tell him it’s at 1123 Main Street.
Domain extensions — the final letters at the end of an Internet address — are
known as the top-level domain, or TLD. They’re called “top-level” because you
read Internet addresses from right to left, and the part after the last dot is the
highest step in a hierarchy that eventually leads down from the Internet as a
whole, step by dotted step, to the particular computer you’re going to. Here
are the current domain extensions:
✓ .aero

Air transportation companies

✓ .asia

Pacific Rim companies

✓ .biz

Business firms

✓ .net

For the travel industry

One problem with all these newer domains is that the general public identifies old standards with reliability, and some folks may tend to see the lesserknown alternatives as misprints or typographical errors. (“Dot what? Don’t
you mean dot com?”) The term dotcom has, in fact, come into colloquial
usage as meaning an Internet-based company.
The funny thing about all these TLDs is that there’s no requirement (in
many cases) for people to use any of them in the manner in which they
were intended. Plenty of nonprofit organizations have .com addresses, and
quite a few .nets have nothing at all to do with ISPs. Go figure. Some of the
new TLDs, such as .museum, have stringent requirements; if you’re not a
museum, you can’t get a .museum address.
The domain extensions that I mention in the preceding bulleted lists are
called generic TLDs, but another kind of TLD exists as well — the country-level
TLD. These TLDs specify the country in which the Web site is based. That’s
not necessarily where the Web server that holds the site is located, thanks
to the global nature of the Internet. Registering the same name in many
countries can be useful if you’re an international organization with multiple
languages to support. That way, you can have a Spanish-language page at
mysite.es, a Japanese-language page at mysite.jp, and so on.

65

66

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
If you’re into alphabet soup, you can toss around such terms as gTLD and
CLTLD for the generic and country-level extensions, respectively, or even iTLD
for international ones. Why there’s a small g and i but an uppercase CL before
the TLD parts is one of the Internet’s great mysteries.

Picking a name
In the early days, it was easy to create a domain name because there weren’t
many of them in use yet. These days, if you want to pick a three- or four-letter
abbreviation or a single word for your domain name, you’re very likely to be
out of luck. Everything short is already taken. The solution? Forget the acronyms and short names. Use phrases instead. The basic idea is to go for anything long enough that it’s unlikely to have been used yet, but short enough
to remember.
To find out whether a name is available, you either just enter a name at a
commercial domain-name registrar (such as GoDaddy) that offers availability
checks or use a WhoIs utility. One of the most familiar ones on the Web is the
Network Solutions page at
www.networksolutions.com/whois/index.jsp
You might also try the nice set of tools at www.whois.net (see Figure 5-3) or
use a stand-alone tool like WhoIs ULTRA, which you can get your hands on at
www.analogx.com/contents/download/network/whois.htm
Take your time and poke around the AnalogX site. You can get some other
wonderful utilities there, too.
What do you do if you come up with a great domain name, but it’s already
taken — and you’ve just gotta have it? Well, it depends. If you’re a company that already has a trademark, the domain name may well already
“belong” to you as a matter of course, even if you haven’t registered it
yet. Well, at any rate, it probably can’t be used legally by anyone else.
If you’ve been trademarked and doing business as, say, Joe’s Acme
Fabuloso Garbanzo Beans and Unicyle Maintenance Company, and that
name’s your registered trademark, anyone else running a site named www.
JoesAcmeFabulosoGarbanzoBeansAndUnicycleMaintenanceCompany.
com is probably easy game for your lawyers.

Chapter 5: Letting the World In: Choosing a Host and Domain Name

Figure 5-3:
WhoIs.net

check for

availability.

You can often buy a domain name from the person or organization that’s
currently using it. It can’t hurt to ask, anyway. Just don’t ask Apple for www.
apple.com or you’ll hear all of the Bay Area laughing at you.
Another factor you need to consider when picking a domain name — besides
the likelihood that some organization is actually using the name and has
already registered it — is that some companies exist to do nothing but think
up good names and register them. These companies, sometimes called
“domain squatters,” seem to have no intention of ever running real Web sites
that use those names, but only — well, it’s hard to think of it as anything but
holding the names hostage. The only purpose they have is to own the name
and sell it to you. And if you think you’ll get it away from them for pocket
change, think again. It’ll cost hundreds of dollars at least — and the upper
end? Limitless for a good name.

Finding a registrar
After you pick a name, you need to register it so nobody else can use it. This
task is usually handled for you by your Web space provider — who’s used to

67

68

Part I: Building Your First Web Site
the job, probably has a bulk account with a major registrar, and fills out zillions of these applications every year.
The best-known registrar of domain names in America is Network Solutions
(www.networksolutions.com). It registers your domain name for $35 a year
if you sign up for one year or for as little as $9.99 a year for a hundred-year
commitment (although that offer might appeal only to the most extremely
optimistic, and you can find better deals with a much shorter commitment).
It used to be that you had to pay for the first two years at once, but in early
2000 this changed so you can pay for only one year if you prefer. Many sites
that offer assistance in registering your domain name still say you have to
cough up two years’ money.
For a long time, Network Solutions was the only registrar on the block, but this
is no longer the case. Today many other registrars compete with it. Prices vary
quite a bit, so it’s a good idea to shop around. The popular GoDaddy.com, for
instance, has prices in the pocket-change range (like $1.99).
The organization that accredits domain name registrars is the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). It maintains lists of
the outfits that are authorized to register your domain name. To register a
domain name by using one of the generic TLDs, go to
www.icann.org/registrars/accredited-list.html
and pick one of the registrars in your region.
To register one of the country-level TLDs, go to www.iana.org/cctld/
cctld-whois.htm and click the name of the country; you find the URL of
the country-level registrar at the bottom of the resulting page.
If you decide you don’t like your current registrar, you can change. Any of the
others will happily take your business away from its competitors.

go beyond the planning stage and get into the

TML was designed to specify the appearance of a Web page, but the
initial implementation left a lot to be desired. In the name of standardization (admittedly, a laudable goal at the time), a great deal of creative control was left behind. An <H1> (major heading) element, for example, would
always look the same, no matter what the designer wanted to show with it. It
would always be the same size, the same color, the same font, and so forth.
With the advent of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), however, all that changed.
Suddenly Webmasters could make anything on a Web page behave any way
they wanted it to. This led, naturally, to a greater degree of creative control —
and more than a little bit of confusion.
In this chapter, I cover the basics of CSS and show you how you can use it
to make your own Web pages dance to the tune of your dreams. There is
so much you can do with CSS that’s beyond the scope of this book, I highly
recommend that (after you read this chapter, of course) you rush out to
the bookstore and get a copy of CSS Web Design For Dummies by Richard
Mansfield (Wiley Publishing).
That said, let’s take a look at CSS and the kinds of things you can accomplish
with it.

Part II: Building Better Web Pages

Merging CSS and HTML
There are three ways to add CSS to your Web pages — inline styles, a style
declaration, or a separate .css file:
✓ Inline styles: With this method, the effect is totally localized. That is to
say, the style you create with this method applies only to the element
that contains it — and to nothing else on the Web page (or on any other
Web pages in your site). An inline style is the simplest kind of CSS, but
lacks flexibility. It uses the style attribute to add CSS. An inline style
that sets the color only for the H1 element in which it is declared looks
like this:
<H1 style=”color: blue”>This is a major heading in
blue.</H1>
✓ Style declaration: This permits you to use the full range of CSS, applying
it throughout a single Web page, but it’s of limited utility when dealing
with a large number of pages on a significant Web site because its effect
is limited to the page on which it is declared, which means you have to
make a separate declaration on each Web page in your site. Such a declaration must occur within the HEAD element of the HTML document. A
style declaration takes a form that looks like this:
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
H1
{color:blue}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>
After such a declaration, the text in all H1 elements on this Web page
will be blue in color.
✓ Separate .css file: This file is linked to the .html files on your Web
site. With this approach, all the creative elements (color, font size, and
the like) are specified in a different file (.css) from the ones that define
the content of the Web pages on your site (.html). This has a tremendous advantage over either of the other two approaches: One .css file
can control the appearance of multiple Web pages. Say, for example,
that you have a Web site with 87 pages. You can readily imagine the
amount of effort involved if you have to go into each and every one of
those Web pages and manually alter all the CSS properties you’d entered
into each of them. Now imagine that there’s just one .css file that you
have to change to effect a new style on every single Web page in your
site. You get the picture, right?

Chapter 6: Using Cascading Style Sheets
A .css file isn’t anything fancy. It’s just a plain text file, like a regular .html
file. You can create one in anything from Windows Notepad to the fanciest
Web page editor. Just make sure you give it an extension of .css (if your program doesn’t already do that for you), and you’ll be fine.
All you have to do is put a link to the .css file in each of your Web pages;
after that, any change in the linked file is reflected automatically in all your
Web pages.
Here’s how it’s done:
1. Create the .css file with the variables relating to font size and color
or whatever other features you want to specify.
2. Create the .html files that define the content of your site.
3. In the HEAD element of each Web page on your site, add the following
lines of code:
<HEAD>
<LINK rel=stylesheet href=”file.css” type=”text/css”>
</HEAD>
Of course, you replace the file part with the name of your actual .css
file.
4. Upload both the .css and .html files to your Web server.
There. You’re done.
After that, if you want to change the appearance of every page on your site,
just alter the .css file and upload the new version. Yep, simple as that. No
kidding.
You can add several different .css files to one .html file by simply listing
them all. Say you have three different style files that apply to your site. The
following code would add them all:
<HEAD>
<LINK rel=stylesheet href=”file1.css” type=”text/css”>
<LINK rel=stylesheet href=”file2.css” type=”text/css”>
<LINK rel=stylesheet href=”file3.css” type=”text/css”>
</HEAD>
Perhaps the hardest thing to keep in mind when dealing with a separate .css
file is also the simplest: You don’t use the <STYLE> tag. In fact, a .css file

75

76

Part II: Building Better Web Pages
doesn’t use any HTML tags at all. Ever. Other than that, the syntax is exactly
the same. Take a look at how the code changes between the two:
✓ Declared style in an .html file:
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
H1
{color:blue}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>
✓ Declared style in a separate .css file:
H1 {
color:blue
}

There’s actually a fourth level of CSS, but Webmasters have no control over
it. A visitor to your site can specify in his Web browser that his own personal
style sheet be used instead of any that is stipulated on the site.

Selectors, Classes, and IDs
Cascading Style Sheets — hmm — the style sheets part of that seems pretty
obvious. Well, with a little struggle, maybe. I honestly cannot tell you why
the inventors decided on sheets instead of files or some other more common
term — that’s just one of life’s little mysteries. But the style part, at least,
should be obvious: It’s a way of establishing the style (appearance) of your
Web pages, giving you much more control than standard HTML does. The
cascading part is, after a moment’s reflection on the way CSS works, also
obvious: The style formatting flows from the top down, just the same as a
waterfall or cascade does. (Perhaps its originators had a sheet of water in
mind. . . .)
The preceding section describes three methods of adding CSS to your Web
pages. The top level in this case is a separate .css file, the next level down
the cascade is a general style declaration, and at the bottom of the cascade
you find your inline styles. Each of these is interpreted in that order.
Whether or not you realize it, you already have a way of using selectors in
CSS. A selector is simply the name of the element or elements that you’re
altering. The H1 element that was used in the preceding examples, for
instance, is a selector, because it selects which parts of your Web page are
affected by your choices.

Chapter 6: Using Cascading Style Sheets

Using classes
What if you don’t want to change all instances of an element, but just want to
change some instances of them? That’s where classes and IDs come in. You
create a class in either a style declaration in the HEAD element of a Web page
or in a separate .css file. The syntax is, by now, familiar:
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
.class1 {color:blue}
.class2 {font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>
If this is done in a separate .css file, you have to leave out the HTML parts
(HEAD and STYLE). Thus the version of the preceding code in a separate .css
file would simply look like this:
.class1 {color:blue}
.class2 {font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}
Pay particular attention to the curly brackets — {} — when you’re choosing styles. In either declared styles or a .css file, the selector comes first,
followed by the opening curly bracket, then the name of the property whose
characteristics you want to specify. Next comes a colon to separate the property from its value (in the preceding example, the property of .class1 is
color and the value is blue). Finally, you close the declaration with the last
curly bracket. Failure to include either bracket (or the colon) will confuse your
visitors’ Web browsers to the point where they probably won’t show what you
intended.
The two lines of code just given declare that any element that is assigned
class1 will be blue, and any element assigned class2 will be in the Arial
font. (The other terms in that font family are the most likely similar fonts in
descending order. Any modern operating system, whether Windows, Unix,
Apple, or whatever, will recognize at least one of them — and use it to display something close to what the Web site designer intended.)
The .class definition is CSS. You recall that CSS and HTML aren’t the same
thing, of course, and HTML has a slightly different way of actually assigning
the declared classes. To use this technique in HTML, about all you have to do
is to drop the dot at the beginning:
<H1 class=”class1”>This text will be blue.</H1>
<H2 class=”class2”>This text will be in the Arial
font.<H2>

77

78

Part II: Building Better Web Pages

Using IDs
The id method is pretty similar to the class method, but with extreme limitations: Unlike a class definition that can be applied to several elements on a
single page, the id method can only be used for a single element per page.
No two elements on one page can have the same id.
So — what good is an id? Say you have some element that is common to several Web pages but shows up in only one context in each page. (Headers and
footers are good examples of this sort of situation.) In such a case, you might
want to assign an id rather than a class, because there is no class, per se,
involved (that is, there is no situation in which you’d want to alter multiple
elements on the same page). Just in case you meet up with a situation like
this one, you can handle it if you follow these steps:
1. In a .css file (external style sheet), specify the id’s name with a
number sign (also called a hash mark), like this:
#makethisred {color:red}
The number sign and the following text specify the name of the id
involved (in this case, makethisred, which should be self-explanatory,
like all good id names), whereas the attributes specified between the
curly brackets set the appearance of the item the id is assigned to.
2. Next, on each Web page where the item appears (only once, remember!), add the id name as an attribute in the appropriate place so the
specified values will be applied to it, as in the following example:
<P id=”makethisred”>This text will be colored red.</P>
You use the number sign (#) only in the definition of the id in the .css
file, not in the application of it in the separate HTML file.

Redefining Elements
If you think you’re stuck with the official definitions of various elements in
HTML, the good news is that you’re wrong. With CSS, you can redefine any
element to have the properties you desire. Don’t care for the Arial or Times
New Roman fonts? No problem. You can substitute anything else for them
you like.
Take the H1 (major heading) element, for example: Without CSS, it’s always
going to have a size of 24 points, a black color, and a bold attribute. In plain
HTML, the H1 element is also in Times New Roman font, even though many
non-European publishers commonly use Arial for headings and Times New

Chapter 6: Using Cascading Style Sheets
Roman for text. You’ll probably want to make such an obvious change, and
CSS lets you do just exactly that. Here’s how you redefine it:
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
H1 {font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>
Henceforth, every H1 element will have that value.
You can, of course, get even fancier if you wish, redefining things to suit yourself by using various attributes. If you want your H1 elements to use gray,
italicized lettering as well as the Arial font, just add those attributes to the
definition:
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
H1 {font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
color:gray;font-style:italic}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>
Whenever you’re adding multiple attributes, be sure to separate them all with
semicolons, as in the preceding example.
The following code shows the effect of altering just the H1 element in this
manner while leaving the H2 element alone:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
H1 {font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
color:gray;font-style:italic}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>This is an H1 heading in Arial, colored gray, and
italicized.</H1>
<H2>This is an H2 heading, unaltered from the
standard.</H2>
</BODY>
<HTML>
Figure 6-1 shows how this works.

79

80

Figure 6-1:

Contextual Selectors
A contextual selector, as you might guess from the apt description, is a selector that works only within a certain context. The context that’s referred to is
the parent element of another element. Normally, when one element is contained within another — as when a heading contains some kind of emphasis
on a particular word (such as bolding it) — the contained element inherits
the properties of its parent element.
Okay, that’s a long-winded way of saying that if you set your H1 elements to
be blue and you add <B></B> tags around one word in one H1 element, that
bolded word will also be blue. But what if you want all the B elements that
appear within an H1 element to turn green? You can do that, no problem.
And, because you’re using contextual selection, no B elements that appear

Chapter 6: Using Cascading Style Sheets
outside an H1 element (that is, outside the context) will be affected. Here’s
how the code for such a style declaration actually looks:
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
H1
{color:blue}
H1 B
{color:green}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>

Going Beyond the Basics
You’re not even remotely limited to just altering the style of common textual
elements, of course. With CSS, you can play with the settings of anything and
everything on your Web pages. The following examples show just a few of the
possibilities that are at your disposal via various CSS attributes.

CSS colors
As previously shown, you can set the background color of any element via
the CSS background-color attribute. In the preceding examples, the value
of the color was set via the simplest method of specifying a textual color
such as “red” or “black.”
There were 16 common text values for colors defined in HTML 4.01: black,
green, silver, lime, gray, olive, white, yellow, maroon, navy, red, blue, purple,
teal, fuchsia, and aqua.
Color names can be used in any color situation, not merely as background
colors. As an example, you can set a font to be colored silver or a border to be
lime.
In addition to these official basic colors, however, several other color names
are commonly recognized by the major Web browsers, and you can also utilize hexadecimal (base 16) or decimal (base 10 in shades of Red, Green, and
Blue) numbers as color values to set a much wider variety of shades. You can

81

82

Part II: Building Better Web Pages
check out the color set known officially as “X11,” complete with examples, at
www.w3.org/TR/css3-iccprof#x11-color.
You should remember to put the number sign (#) in front of hexadecimal numbers; that’s what tells a Web browser that it’s dealing with a hex value. If you
forget to do that, some browsers will forgive you, but others won’t.

Borders
Chapter 3 discusses the use of borders when you’re using frames — but
thanks to the versatility of CSS, you can also use borders with any element on
your Web pages.
To set the kind of border you want to surround a particular element, use the
border attribute. You have several options here: none, dotted, dashed,
solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, or outset.
Obviously, the none value is pretty much useless, as very few elements have
a border by default. Figure 6-2 shows the other options as specified in the following code example:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<STYLE>
.class1 {border:dotted}
.class2 {border:dashed}
.class3 {border:solid}
.class4 {border:double}
.class5 {border:groove}
.class6 {border:ridge}
.class7 {border:inset}
.class8 {border:outset}
</STYLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1 class=”class1”>This has a dotted border.</P>
<H1 class=”class2”>This has a dashed border.</H1>
<H1 class=”class3”>This has a solid border.</H1>
<H1 class=”class4”>This has a double border.</H1>
<H1 class=”class5”>This has a grooved border.</H1>
<H1 class=”class6”>This has a ridged border.</H1>
<H1 class=”class7”>This has an inset border.</H1>
<H1 class=”class8”>This has an outset border.</H1>
</BODY>
</HTML>

Chapter 6: Using Cascading Style Sheets

CSS and WYSIWYG
When you’re using a sophisticated Web-development environment (such as
CoffeeCup or Dreamweaver), you can ease your workload a great deal by
simply letting the program take care of most of the drudgery for you. Every
major WYSIWYG program has some sort of CSS feature that allows even a
novice Webmaster to take control like an old pro (see Chapter 10 for using
CSS to create button-based menus in CoffeeCup).

Figure 6-2:
Various border designs
in CSS.

To add styles to your Web page using CoffeeCup, follow these steps:
1. Starting from a new or existing Web page loaded in CoffeeCup, click
the Style Sheet Items icon on the toolbar and select Style Sheet Wizard
as shown in Figure 6-3.
Doing so brings up the dialog box shown in Figure 6-4.

2. Enter the name of the style in the text box, then click the OK button.
You’re now looking at the Style Sheet Wizard, shown in Figure 6-5.
3. Select the font attributes you want to apply to this style, if any, by
clicking the downward-pointing arrows on the right side.
4. Next, click the Color and Background tab.
This opens the related options as shown in Figure 6-6.

5. Click the downward-pointing arrows to the right to select text or background colors from a color chart (see Figure 6-7).
If you don’t see what you want, click the More Colors button to open a
color wheel. Click on the colors in that wheel to choose one.

6. To add a background image to the style, click the Browse button, navigate to the desired graphics file, and select it.
If you want to select characteristics of the background image, go ahead.
You can decide whether it repeats or shows only one copy, whether it
scrolls or remains fixed in position, and where it shows up on-screen
(this works just like positioning layers — see the later section on positioning with layers).
7. Click the Alignment tab to access the choices shown in Figure 6-8.
You can set the Indentation as a length in pixels or as a percentage.
Whichever you select, you can specify the value by selecting from the
scrolling values at the right.
With Line Height, you have those two options — as well as one called
Multiplier, which lets you specify a whole-number value (such as twice
the usual height, for example).
For Alignment, you can set either the vertical or horizontal value. For
the vertical value, the Keyword option specifies the HTML attributes
such as middle or top; you may also set the vertical alignment as a percentage. Horizontal alignment options are simply center, justify, left, or
right.
Word and letter spacing are simple pixel values.

Chapter 6: Using Cascading Style Sheets

8. Click the Margins tab (see Figure 6-9).
The Left and Right Margins have three options, as does Width: Auto
(or the default, the same as setting nothing), Absolute (in pixels), and
Percentage. Top and Bottom Margins and Height have Absolute and
Percentage values.

9. Click the Padding tab (shown in Figure 6-10).
Recall that all CSS values are applied to a rectangular area. Just as with
table cells, you can set the contents so there’s some space (padding)
between them and the edges. The only options are absolute (a certain
number of pixels) or percentage.

Figure 6-10:
Setting the
padding
values.

10. Click the Border tab (see Figure 6-11).
The style’s borders (see the section on borders earlier in this chapter)
can be set via these options. All four have the same choices: Fixed,
Absolute, or Percentage. The options on the right will change, depending upon your choice. For Fixed, you get a drop-down list allowing you
to choose values of none, thin, medium, or thick for the lines of the
border. The other two work just like similar options already
discussed.
Colors are chosen the same way as text colors (see Step 5).
11. Click the OK button to finish the style.

Layers
Layers? Okay, not layers, DIVs. This is an old argument going way back to
the old browser wars between Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Netscape
Navigator (the program that was the ancestor of both IE and today’s Firefox
browser). Microsoft, having much more money and clout, clearly won that
war; few people today even remember what Netscape was, but the older,
more aptly descriptive terminology has stuck, despite the fact that the official name for a layer today is a DIV (division of a Web page).
The DIV goes in the BODY element of your Web page. A DIV is defined as a
rectangle with a specified width, height, and upper-left corner position. These
three factors are all that a Web browser needs to know to create the layer: Start
at this location, and then extend a rectangle downward and to the right by this
many pixels. That rectangle acts as a kind of miniature Web page within the
larger Web page; it can contain anything that a normal Web page can.
The concept of layers actually goes back further than that, to the days when
an overhead projector was the hottest high-tech item on the market. If you’re
old enough (or recently attended a low-tech school), you probably have
memories of your teachers placing one transparency on top of another on an
overhead projector, which resulted in the information on the second transparency showing up on the screen on top of the information on the first one.
The first transparency was the lower layer; the second was the higher layer;
and so forth.

89

90

Part II: Building Better Web Pages
Web pages can be thought of in the same way — as one layer of information
superimposed upon another, lower layer. A third, higher layer can then be
placed on it, and so forth, ad infinitum.
Many Web site designers take advantage of this ability to provide distinct
types of information on top of one another. This may be a series of maps
showing (for example) Europe before, during, and after the Napoleonic Wars,
with a user interface that allows Web-site visitors to view them in whatever
sequence they desire. This is called an overlay in cartographic terminology,
which you’ll often find in sophisticated mapping programs such as Google
Earth. (Shameless plug time: Be sure to see this author’s Google Earth For
Dummies [Wiley Publishing] if it’s not already a part of your collection.)

Absolute positioning
Absolute positioning is placing a DIV element based on the upper-left corner
of the Web page itself, rather than basing the position on anything contained
within the Web page. Thus, a DIV that is absolutely positioned at, say, 50
pixels in and down from the upper-left corner will be only half as far from
the left and top margins as one that’s absolutely positioned 100 pixels in and
down.
To set a DIV to an absolute position, you simply need to specify that this is
what you want — and set how far from the left and top of the Web page you
want the upper-left corner of your DIV to be. For example, for a rectangle
that’s 100 pixels by 100 pixels in size, use the following code to set its absolute position to 50 pixels in and 50 pixels down:
<BODY>
<DIV
style=”position:absolute;top:50;left:50;width:100;
height:100”>
</DIV>
</BODY>
To specify this — as well as one that is 100 pixels in and down, as in the
example mentioned in the first paragraph — you’d change the code to read
as follows:
<BODY>
<DIV
style=”position:absolute;top:50;left:50;width:100;
height:100”;background-color:gray>
</DIV>
<DIV
style=”position:absolute;top:100;left:100;width:100;
height:100”;background-color:black>
</DIV>
</BODY>

Chapter 6: Using Cascading Style Sheets
Note that both DIVs in this style declaration go within the BODY element.
Also, for the purpose of better showing them in this example, each DIV has
a different background color assigned to it — specified by (as you may have
guessed) the background-color attribute.
Figure 6-12 shows the two DIVs given absolute positions.

Figure 6-12:
Setting an
absolute
position.

Relative positioning
Relative positioning is simple to implement: You simply use the word
relative instead of the word absolute in your HTML code. Otherwise it
works the same as absolute positioning does except for one critical factor —
its origin point. It’s based not on the upper-left corner of the Web page, but
on the upper-left corner of the containing element. Doubtless you recall that
everything on a Web page is contained within something else — the BODY element is contained within the HTML element, and so forth — thus, with relative
positioning, you have to pay careful attention to this container relationship
unless you really, really like dealing with unpredictable results on your Web
pages.

91

92

Part II: Building Better Web Pages
If, for example, one DIV is contained within another one, then you have to
calculate the second one’s positioning relative to its parent DIV element’s position, not to the Web page as a whole. Say the contained DIV is set to a relative
position of 200 pixels in and 200 pixels down. If the parent DIV is set to 100,100,
then the position of the child DIV is going to be 300,300 (the position of the
upper-left corner of the parent DIV plus the position of the child DIV).
To modify the earlier example to do that, you’d change the code to read
something like this:
<BODY>
<DIV
style=”position:absolute;top:200;left:200;width:100;
height:100;background-color:gray”>
<DIV
style=”position:relative;top:100;left:100;width:100;
height:100;background-color:black”>
</DIV>
</DIV>
</BODY>
Notice that the second <DIV> tag begins before the first layer is closed
with its </DIV> tag. Thus, the second one is enclosed within the first one.
Because the second one’s relative positioning values are the same as the size
of the first DIV, the upper-left corner of the second DIV is located exactly
where the first one’s lower-right corner falls — instead of in the middle of it,
as in the preceding example (see Figure 6-13).

Adding Images
In This Chapter
▶ Getting free graphics
▶ Optimizing graphics files
▶ Creating free logos
▶ Editing images
▶ Designing with images

Y

ou can have a perfectly functional Web site without images. But if you
compare your site with one that’s just as functional but also uses graphics, yours will probably lose out in terms of attracting visitors. Most people
will go to the other site and leave yours gathering electronic dust.
In this chapter, I take you on a whirlwind tour of places where you can download images by the bushel, I suggest methods for modifying images in fabulous ways, and I share lots of other tips to improve your site’s appearance.

Getting Graphics — for Free!
Most of us aren’t artists, and even if I know an artist or three, most of them
spend their time mucking about with paintbrushes and canvases. Many aren’t
really comfortable with electronic media. So how do average people who
want nice graphics for their Web sites get them? The good news is that excellent graphics are all over the place. Graphics are an integral part of the World
Wide Web, and the quality of those graphics has improved tremendously
from the early days of the Internet.

Heeding copyrights and credits
Every Web browser is a funnel for graphics. Any image that you can see in
it, you can download and put on your site — technically speaking, anyway.

96

Part II: Building Better Web Pages
But you need to consider a few factors before you use graphics. Yes, you can
grab every image file you find. But you can’t necessarily use them all without
consequences.
When an artist creates an image, that artist owns the copyright to that image.
Just as the word says, that gives the artist — and the artist alone — the right
to make copies, electronic or otherwise. The artist can give other people permission to make copies of the image — or even sell the copyright to someone — but unless he or she does so, the artist retains total control over the
image.
Never take legal advice from anyone who spells copyright as copywrite.
One of the few ways in which someone can lose a copyright is by stating that
he’s placing a work in the public domain, which means that he’s surrendering his copyright, and others can do anything that they want with the work.
Many people don’t understand what public domain means, though — and
you sometimes run across a statement on a Web site that says something
incredible like, “I retain the copyright to all these images, but I’m placing
them in the public domain, so feel free to use them.” If you find one of these
contradictory disclaimers and you really want to use the images, your best
course is to contact the artist for clarification.
Typically, you find five different situations with fine print on an artist’s Web
site, as the following list describes:
✓ The artist states that you can’t use the images. Just walk away — you
can find plenty of others out there.
✓ The artist states that you can use the images without any conditions. Go
ahead and download to your heart’s content.
✓ The artist states that you can use the images if you do certain things,
such as include a link back to the page they’re on or include a copyright
notice under the image. Do what the artist asks and use the images.
✓ The artist states that you can use the images freely if you run a noncommercial site but that commercial sites must pay. If you’re commercial
and the work is good, pay up — it’s not going to break the bank. After
all, you’re not buying a Renoir original here.
✓ The artist provides no information at all about usage. Either walk away
or e-mail the artist to find out the policy.

Creating your own images
The easiest way to avoid copyright problems is to make your own images.
That way you own the copyright — unless you’re working under contract for
someone such as a Web design firm, in which case that company

Chapter 7: Adding Images
probably owns the copyright. It’s impossible for me to cover all you need to
know about copyright in the limited space available here, but the subject is
well covered in Creating Web Graphics For Dummies, by Bud Smith and Peter
Frazier (Wiley Publishing).
Of course, the digital camera revolution also gives you an unprecedented
opportunity to create your own Web-ready graphics (check out Digital
Photography For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Julie Adair King), and programs like
Photoshop and Fireworks make it relatively easy for even those of us who
aren’t very graphically talented to come up with professional-level graphics.
Table 7-1 shows the URLs for several popular graphics programs.

Differentiating among
graphics file formats
Sometimes it seems there are about as many different graphics file formats
as there are people in Manhattan on a Monday afternoon. Every company
from Adobe to Kodak has its own way of showing electronic images. When it
comes to the Web, though, you really need to consider only three formats —
the three that work in all major (and most minor) Web browsers:
✓ GIF: The venerable old GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) file format
still sees a lot of use on the Web. Because GIF limits you to 256 colors,
it’s best to use for images that don’t have lots of colors or much in the
way of subtle shifts between colors. GIF also has a unique capability — it
can contain several images in a single file. These images appear sequentially as you view the GIF file, resulting in a cheap and easy form of
animation.
✓ JPEG: The relatively newer JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
format, also commonly known as JPG because people still have the habit
of using DOS 8.3-type filenames, has radically different capabilities. JPEG

97

98

Part II: Building Better Web Pages
is a true color format, so you don’t need to worry about any color limitations. It also stores image information in a different way, resulting in a
highly compressed file that’s usually much smaller than a GIF file of the
same image.
✓ PNG: The latest puppy in the window is the PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) format. (You pronounce it ping.) PNG does everything that
the GIF format does, except create animated images, and does quite a
few things much better — such as providing better transparency capabilities. (A more sophisticated format known as MNG — Multiple-image
Network Graphics — that’s currently in the works includes the capability to create animated images.)

Putting Your Graphics on
a Diet with GIFWorks
Fat files are embarrassing. They slow down a page like nothing else, turning
a fabulous site into a sluggish turkey. A really good graphics program can
trim your overweight files, but such a program will also set you back a pretty
penny, and you’ll have to work with it for a while if you want to get the most
out of it. Instead of putting all that money and effort into solving the file-size
problem, try some of the following Web sites that do the job for you — for free.
GIFWorks is absolutely one of the best tools you’ll find on the Web. Period.
You get the idea I like it? A lot? There’s a good reason: This is one truly fullfeatured program, and it’s something you may not be familiar with yet — but
I think it’s the wave of the future on the Web. This program isn’t one you
download and use on your computer. It stays put, and you use it right on the
GIFWorks site.
With GIFWorks, you can do everything to GIF files (but only GIF files), from
reducing colors to adding special effects. So what does it cost? Nothing,
nada, zip. And to top it all off, the same folks have a site that lets you get
your hands on zillions of high-quality images (the Animation Factory, at www.
animfactory.com). I’m not exaggerating when I say quality, either. This is
some of the best stuff I’ve seen.
Unlike GIFWorks, you have to pay for The Animation Factory, but their rates
are within just about any budget — anywhere from $59.95 for a year’s download privileges to the highest rate of $199.95 for a year of the top pro-level
service. You don’t have to pay any further fees for using the images. The
Animation Factory is well worth the price, even if you don’t run a commercial Web site — and GIFWorks shows the same attention to quality but costs
nothing at all.

Chapter 7: Adding Images
Here’s how to upload your image to GIFWorks:
1. Go to www.gifworks.com/image_editor.html.
2. Choose File➪Open Image from the GIFWorks menu options, as shown
in Figure 7-1.
Come back to this page later and check out the File➪New 3D Text
option. It’s a great way to create animated text banners.
3. On the next page, open a file from the Web by entering its URL and
clicking the Fetch Image button. Or upload a file from your local drive
by clicking the Browse button, selecting the file, and then clicking the
Upload Image button.
GIFWorks operates on a copy of the image you specify. It doesn’t change
the original file in any way.
After the image is uploaded to GIFWorks, it appears in the program, as
shown in Figure 7-2.
I’m using a dog from the collection at www.bestanimations.com for
this example. The dog is animated, which is one of the great strengths
of GIFWorks. Many programs can modify and optimize individual GIF
images, but an animated GIF is composed of many different images —
eight of them, in this case — and GIFWorks can modify all of them simultaneously, thus altering the animated image.

Before you begin to work with the image, click the Help menu and take a look
at the FAQ.
After your image is at GIFWorks, what you do with the image depends on
your situation. Here are some options you can choose from:
✓ To reduce the file size quickly: Choose Optimize➪Reduce Colors from
the menu bar. You get a whole page full of different versions of the original image, each with fewer colors than the preceding ones. You also get
information about the file size, number of remaining colors, and percentage reduction. Scroll down the page, look at each image, and download
the one that represents the best compromise between image quality and
file size.
✓ To make a color transparent: Choose Edit➪Transparify from the menu
options. In the pop-up window that appears, click the color you want
to see through. To make a transparent GIF totally opaque, do the same
thing, but start by choosing Edit➪Un-Transparify.
✓ To view information on file size, width, height, and so on: Choose
View➪Image Info.

Chapter 7: Adding Images
Okay, that’s all the practical stuff that most Webmasters need. Now for the
fun part. After you’re done being responsible, head for the Effects menu and
start playing. You can do so many things to your images that you may have
a hard time choosing among them. Unless you’re dead set on just trying anything that comes to hand, choose Help➪Effects Gallery to look at some examples. Figure 7-3 shows what applying some of the effects did to the image
shown in Figure 7-2. Enjoy.

Creating a Logo with CoolText.com
If you want a free logo fast and you don’t mind doing it yourself, try CoolText.
com at — you guessed it — www.cooltext.com. This Web site generates
graphics, according to the options that you choose, while you wait. The process is simple and fun, and there’s no limit to the number of logos you can
experiment with.
Not only are its logos cool, but so are the site’s legal requirements: none, zip,
nada. There’s no copyright issue to deal with, no ads stuck in the middle of
things, and no fine print of any kind. As an act of gratitude for such a great

101

102 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
service, you may want to add a link back to this site from yours, but even
that’s not required.
Although CoolText.com doesn’t hold a copyright on the logos you create, you
probably do. I’m not a lawyer (and I don’t even play one on TV), but it seems
to me that the decisions you make during the course of designing the logos
qualify them as artistic creations. Don’t take my word for it, though. If this
point is important for your situation, check with an attorney who really knows
copyright law — or e-mail the U.S. Copyright Office at copyinfo@loc.gov.
To make a custom logo at CoolText.com, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.cooltext.com.
2. Scroll down and click any logo style under Choose a Logo Style, as
shown in Figure 7-4.
This takes you to the logo design page, shown in Figure 7-5.

Different logo styles offer different options. Depending on the style that
you choose, these options may set colors, determine whether text is
engraved or raised, and so forth. In this example, I’m using the Alien
Glow design.
3. Type the text for your logo in the Logo Text text box.
You usually type your site or company name here, although you can
type anything that you want. If you need more than one line, you can put
a new line symbol (\n) in the text, as in the following example:
First Line\nSecond Line
4. Click the font name (in this example, Futura Poster), and then select a
font category from the list that’s presented. Finally, select the name of
a particular font.
You’re returned automatically to the design page.
5. Enter a font size in the Text Size text box.
6. Click the Predefined Color picker (to the right of the color bar) for the
Glow Color category and then select a glow color from the resulting
color picker Web page. (See Figure 7-6.)

103

104 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
This Web page gives you a long list of named colors, with examples of
each color. Just decide which color you like and click it to return to
CoolText.com with that color selected. You can specify a glow color
either by entering numerical values in the R, G, and B text boxes to indicate the RGB (red, green, and blue) components, or by entering its hexadecimal value to the right.
7. Repeat Step 6 for the other three color settings (Outer Text Color,
Inner Text Color, and Background Color).
8. Click the current background image in the Background Image category (if one hasn’t been chosen, click None), and then click one of the
textures on the resulting Web page. (See Figure 7-7.)
You’re returned to CoolText.com with that texture selected.
If you need more textures, click the links at the top of the textures page
to view more pages.
9. If you want to specify a file format, click the Edit button for the File
Format category and then select one of the file formats in the resulting
list.

Now, all you have to do is sit back and wait until your logo shows up. If you
like it, download it right away because it exists on CoolText.com’s server for
only about an hour. If you don’t like it, back up and monkey with the settings
until you get what you want.
While you’re at CoolText.com, check out the button generator, too. You
access it by clicking the Buttons link at the top of the page.

Editing Images
There are plenty of times when you’ll need to tweak an image to get it “just
so” for your site. All graphics programs give you some options for doing this
sort of thing, and they all work pretty much the same way. In this section, I
show you how to use a handy little graphics editor called IrfanView (www.
irfanview.com) to spiff up your Web graphics quickly and easily.

105

106 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
Resizing
Although you can make an image appear smaller on a Web page than it really
is (see the “Sizing images in HTML” section, later in this chapter), it’s usually
best to set the size deliberately before the image ends up on your site.
This is a simple process, although there are a couple of caveats. When you
resize an image, your graphics program has to change the pixels — the color
dots that make up the image. Obviously, a larger image will take more pixels
and a smaller one will take fewer. This means either adding pixels (interpolation) or subtracting pixels (resampling).
Although graphics interpolation has come a long way, any image-resizing process still has to make some compromises. Shrinking an image usually doesn’t
damage the capability to view the picture, but it always has to mean some
loss of detail. Enlarging an image can add areas of blockiness due to the additional pixels needed to fill the new space.
The best resizing is a minor resizing.
Open the image you want to resize in IrfanView, and then follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Resize/Resample from the menu.
In the Resize/Resample Image dialog box, shown in Figure 7-8, there are
three methods of setting the new image size:
• To specify a particular physical size, in the Set New Size panel,
select pixels, centimeters, or inches, and then enter the new width
and height in the Width and Height text boxes.
If the Preserve Aspect Ratio check box is selected, you have
to enter only one of the values; the other will be automatically
entered.
• To use a percentage, select the Set New Size as Percentage of
Original radio button, and then enter the appropriate numbers in
the Width and Height text boxes.
• To use common sizes, click the appropriate button or select a radio
button in the Some Standard Dimensions panel.
2. Click the OK button.
3. Save the image.
If you don’t save the image after you make your changes, you’ll lose it.

Chapter 7: Adding Images

Cropping
What if you want part of a picture but not all of it? Get out the scissors — it’s
croppin’ time. You can cut out any rectangular section you want — you’ll
probably do this a lot, so you’ll be happy to hear how easy it is.
Open the image you want to crop in IrfanView, and then follow these steps:
1. Place your mouse pointer at one corner of the area you want to crop
and then click.
2. While holding down the left mouse button, drag the mouse pointer to
the opposite corner of your area.
As you do so, a guide box shows you the currently selected area. (See
Figure 7-9.)
3. When you have the area you want selected, release the mouse button.
4. Choose Edit➪Crop Selection from the menu.
Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+Y.

Rotating and flipping
Just like a picture hanging on a wall, an image on your Web site can sometimes look better if it’s repositioned. A slight turn to the right, perhaps, or
maybe even a complete inversion for a shocking effect. Graphically, I’m talking about rotation and flips.

107

108 Part II: Building Better Web Pages

There are two kinds of rotation in IrfanView. Simple rotation is always by
90 degrees. Four of these rotations in a row return the image to its original
state. Custom rotation allows you to specify an exact number of your choice
instead.
To do a simple rotation, just choose Image from the menu, and then click
Rotate Right or Rotate Left.
For a custom rotation, do this instead:
1. Choose Image➪Custom/Fine Rotation from the menu.
The Rotate by Angle dialog box appears.
2. In the dialog box shown in Figure 7-10, enter the degree (up to two
decimal points) of rotation. Use a minus sign (–) for leftward rotation.

Chapter 7: Adding Images
3. The dialog box displays the original image on the left and the altered
one on the right. If you aren’t satisfied with the results of your rotation, repeat Step 2 until the altered image suits your needs.
4. Click the OK button.

Figure 7-10:
Doing a fine
rotation.

Flipping an image is done in pretty much the same way as a simple rotation —
choose Image➪Vertical Flip or Image➪Horizontal Flip from the menu — but it
isn’t the same thing as rotating an image 180 degrees. Remember that a flip is a
mirror image instead of a turned one.

Adjusting color
Color adjustments include a range of possibilities. The most basic are color
reduction (for example, making a 256-color image into a 16-color one) and
grayscale conversion. The more complex include setting the proportions of
red, green, and blue and monkeying with the contrast and brightness.
Gamma correction is a highfalutin term for fixing an image that’s too light or
dark. You’ll often find this situation when viewing an image on a PC that was
done on a Mac.
To do a simple color reduction with IrfanView, follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Decrease Color Depth from the menu.
The Decrease Color Depth dialog box appears.
2. In the dialog box shown in Figure 7-11, select one of the radio buttons
to select a standard color depth.
If you select the Custom radio button, be sure to enter another number
of colors into the Custom text box.

109

110 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
Figure 7-11:
Reducing
colors is
easy.

3. Click the OK button.
Grayscale conversion is even easier. Just choose Image➪Convert to
Grayscale from the menu.
Although the most complex color adjustments are a bit more involved,
IrfanView wraps them in an easy-to-use package with lots of options. Load up
an image and give it a go:
1. Choose Image➪Enhance Colors from the menu.
2. In the Enhance Colors dialog box (see Figure 7-12), drag the sliders or
type values into the text boxes.
As you do so, the reference image on the right shows the changes you’re
making; the original image isn’t affected by your experimentation, so feel
free to play around with all the settings. You can, at any time, click the
Set Default Values button to put everything back to normal.
3. If the reference image isn’t large enough for you, click the Apply to
Original button.

Chapter 7: Adding Images
This adds all your changes to your full-size original image. Note, however, that you still haven’t actually altered it; all you have to do is click
the Cancel button to return to normal.
4. When you’re finished, click the OK button to keep your changes or
the Cancel button to abort them.

Using special effects filters
There’s a lot you can do with most of today’s graphics programs, but there’s
always something more that’s possible. That’s where filters come in. A filter is
a special-effects wizard that alters your images automatically in various ways.
You might, for example, apply a filter to a photograph to make the photo look
like an oil painting or pencil sketch.
IrfanView has its own set of ready-to-use filters. It can also use your
Photoshop-compatible filters. The best way to gain a quick understanding of
what filters can do is to check out the Effects Browser:
1. Choose Image➪Effects from the menu.
2. Choose the Effects Browser option from the resulting submenu.
3. In the Image Effects dialog box shown in Figure 7-13, select the names
of the various built-in effects filters.
As you do so, the twin images show you how the original compares to
the filtered version.
4. Enter any requested values required by the filter.
5. When you’re done, click the OK button to keep your changes, or click
the Cancel button to abort them.

Basic Design with Images
Getting or creating images is one thing. Knowing the right images to get (or to
make) is another, and knowing what to do with them is perhaps most important of all. Misusing graphics — using either too many or too few — can make
an otherwise outstanding Web site into an unpleasant mess. This section
explores the proper use of images in Web page design.

Placing images for maximum effectiveness
It’s easy to overdo any element on a Web page. It’s not uncommon to run
across sites that are all, or almost all, text — which is fine for some technical
material, but pretty dicey if you’re trying to appeal to the general public. At
the opposite extreme, you’ll find pages that are (in effect) nothing but one
image after another, with perhaps a small bit of text that often leaves you
more confused than when you started.
Balancing visual elements with text is key to good Web site design. The CNN.
com front page illustrates this point well. It’s functional, eye catching, and
well balanced. Figure 7-14 shows the top portion of the Web page. Note that
it’s strongly graphical. Even the text and links are all tied in to their attendant
graphical background, their colors nicely suiting the overall look of the page.

Figure 7-14:
The top of
the CNN.
com home
page is

graphical.

Chapter 7: Adding Images
The major image at the top — a photo and its surrounding frame — is the
largest single graphical element on the page, reflecting its importance as
showing the latest top story. Farther down (see Figure 7-15), there are
smaller photos illustrating other stories; the whole is well balanced by the
set of text links leading to various news reports.
This site has a particularly interesting feature: Except for the news story’s
text links, virtually all the text is either embedded in or otherwise associated
with a graphic. And very little of the graphic material is in the form of photos,
drawings, or other commonly used image types. You do find heavy use of
graphical dividers to help structure the visual appeal of the page — but
they’re small and don’t overpower the other elements nearby.
Your own artistic judgment must be the ultimate guide, but these guidelines
will help you to create better-designed Web pages:
✓ Keep most images relatively small. How small depends upon two factors:
the number of images you have on the page and simple visibility.
✓ Use your largest picture or artwork as the lead-in to the rest of your
material. If it’s not the most important image, it probably shouldn’t be
the biggest one, either.
✓ Use small divider images to separate subject areas.
✓ Don’t allow advertising images to overwhelm the basic material of the
Web page.

114 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
Sizing images in HTML
Besides file size, you need to consider the physical size of images. Each
image, when displayed in a Web browser, takes up a certain amount of real
estate on your visitors’ screens. Very often, a particular image you want to
use just doesn’t happen to be the size you want it to be.
You can fire up your favorite graphics program, load the image, resize and
resample it, and then resave it. Or you can just let your visitor’s Web browser
do all the work for you. The ability to alter the size of an image on a Web
page is built in to HTML. Although it isn’t required, it’s good form to specify
the width and height of an image, as demonstrated here:
<IMG width=”100” height=”30”>
Normally you would use the actual size of the image, of course. But you can
use any values. To make the image take up more space on a Web page, just
enter larger numbers. To make it smaller — you guessed it — enter smaller
values instead.
You have to be careful to resize the image proportionally, unless you’re looking for some weird effect. If you want to quadruple the area of the example
image — from 3,000 pixels to 12,000 pixels, for example — you set the width to
200 and the height to 60.
See Chapter 2 for details on how to place images.

I don’t list any image repositories in this table. An image repository is a Web
site that simply provides about a zillion images for download without any
regard for where they came from or what kind of legal troubles they may
cause for you. They typically involve all sorts of copyright and trademark violations — and the fact that such a repository provides the Donald Duck

Adding Forms
In This Chapter
▶ Adding the FORM tag
▶ Setting up interaction
▶ Getting text info
▶ Offering visitor choices
▶ Checking for CGI access
▶ Implementing CGI scripts
▶ Using form makers

A

Web form consists of a series of elements that, together, enable you to
gather information from your visitors. A Web form’s two most common
uses are for getting user data when a visitor signs up for “membership” and
getting purchaser info when making a sale.
The first step in your form design process is, of course, to figure out what information you need from your visitors. Next you need to determine which form
elements are best suited for getting that info. After you’ve done that, you type
the HTML and (finally) arrange to submit the form’s data for processing.
You doubtless recall from Chapter 2 that all HTML tags are enclosed within
other tags, and forms are no exception. The <FORM> tag goes within the BODY
element, so your basic form setup will look like this:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<FORM>
</FORM>
</BODY>
</HTML>

118 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
If you fail to follow this pattern properly, in which each element is properly
nested, the form may not work. Web browsers are very forgiving, however, so
you might still get away with it.

Getting Input
The most important part of a Web form, next to the <FORM> tag itself, is the
<INPUT> tag. The various permutations of the INPUT element allow you to
get input in a wide variety of formats, ranging from simple text to a series of
Yes and No options.
The INPUT element includes several types such as check boxes, password
fields, and even an option for a user to upload a file. I’ll go over the most
useful of these in the following sections, but here’s the basic way to handle
specifying the particulars:
<FORM>
<INPUT type=”text”>
<INPUT type=”checkbox”>
<INPUT type=”submit”>
</FORM>
Note that there is no closing tag for the INPUT element.
As shown in Figure 8-1, this simple code example results in the elements
all lying side by side. To put them all on separate lines for layout purposes,
you’d need to add a line break between each pair, like this:
<FORM>
<INPUT type=”text”>
<BR>
<INPUT type=”checkbox”>
<BR>
<INPUT type=”submit”>
</FORM>
The version with line breaks results in the layout shown in Figure 8-2.
For a really neat form layout, try putting its elements into a table (see
Chapter 3).

Chapter 8: Adding Forms

Some basic
INPUT
types.

Figure 8-2:
Separating
lines.

119

120 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
Of course, a typical form uses several of the same INPUT types over and over
again. You’ll need to give each element a particular name in order to distinguish it from similar elements. Otherwise it would be impossible to tell the
difference between (for example) the three text boxes asking for a visitor’s
first name, middle initial, and last name.
You do this via the name attribute, as you might expect. The example just
mentioned would be coded like this:
<FORM>
<INPUT type=”text” name=”firstname”>
<INPUT type=”text” name=”middleinitial”>
<INPUT type=”text” name=”lastname”>
</FORM>

Typing in text boxes
Text boxes are simple, one-line rectangles that typically contain information
such as names and addresses, and you’ve got a bunch of options you can
specify when it comes to using them.
The most obvious of these is setting the length of the text box. This capability enables you to create a more pleasing layout and (incidentally) save
space. To expand on the example in the preceding section, you might set the
length of the user name text boxes like this:
<FORM>
First Name: <INPUT type=”text” name=”firstname” size=”15”>
Middle Initial: <INPUT type=”text” name=”middleinitial”
size=”1”>
Last Name: <INPUT type=”text” name=”lastname” size=”20”>
</FORM>
Figure 8-3 shows the results (note that, despite the size limit on the middle
initial, both Firefox and Internet Explorer expand it to three characters).
The size attribute specifies the number of typed characters, not the number
of pixels, and the width of characters depends on the font being used.
Of course, when it comes to setting the length, you have to just take your
best shot at what will work best. Some last names are five letters long
whereas others may be more than 20. Fortunately, the size of the text box
doesn’t actually limit the size of the data entered into it. If someone types
a 100-character entry into a size 20 text box, all 100 characters will still be
entered, and the text will simply scroll as it’s typed.

Chapter 8: Adding Forms

Figure 8-3:
Limiting the
size of text
boxes.

But what if the program you’re using to process the data has a limit on the
size of the data it will accept? This is a pretty common situation, and you’ll
be happy to know that there’s a simple way to handle this problem: You use
the maxlength attribute. The following code shows how to adapt our example to accept no more than a particular number of characters:
<FORM>
<INPUT type=”text” name=”firstname” size=”15”
maxlength=”50”>
<INPUT type=”text” name=”middleinitial” size=”1”
maxlength=”1”>
<INPUT type=”text” name=”lastname” size=”20”
maxlength=”50”>
</FORM>
In this case, the first and last names are limited to 50 characters in length; the
middle initial, of course, is set to a single character.
If you’re using a form that requires a user to enter a password, it’s customary to
use, in the place of a regular text box, a specialized password text box that —
you guessed it — you enter by typing this line:
<INPUT type=”password”>

121

122 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
With password text boxes, when a user enters his or her password, a series
of asterisks is shown instead of the typed letters, thus protecting the user’s
security if someone else is peeking at the screen. That’s the only difference;
You use the same options as with regular text boxes.
The following code sets up the example shown in Figure 8-4:
<FORM>
User Name: <INPUT type=”text” name=”username” size=”25”
maxlength=”50”>
<BR>
<BR>
Password: <INPUT type=”password” name=”middleinitial”
size=”25” maxlength=”50”>
</FORM>

Figure 8-4:
Regular and
password
text boxes.

Using text areas
There are lots of cases when you’ll want to get some textual data that just
doesn’t fit comfortably in a one-line box. Say, for example, that you have an
order form where you ask buyers if they have any special instructions. The

Chapter 8: Adding Forms
answers you get to such a question may run to several paragraphs rather
than just a few words.
That’s where text areas come in handy: You can use them to set up a box as
wide and as tall as you want.
The most important way text areas differ from text boxes is that they are
not (as you might normally expect) yet another type of the INPUT element.
Instead, you use the TEXTAREA element.
This code example shows the difference between the two:
<FORM>
User Name: <INPUT type=”text” name=”username” size=”25”
maxlength=”50”>
<BR>
<BR>
Special Instructions:
<BR>
<TEXTAREA name=”specinst” cols=”100” rows=”20”>
</TEXTAREA>
</FORM>
This specifies a text area with a width of 100 columns and a height of 20 rows,
as shown in Figure 8-5.
You have to use the </TEXTAREA> end tag!

Choosing radio buttons or check boxes
When it comes to basic choices, you’ll want to use check boxes or radio buttons. The round radio buttons (also called option buttons) are used for mutually exclusive choices; the square check boxes are used in situations where
several simultaneous choices might be made.
For example, if you have a Yes or No situation, you’d use radio buttons, as in
the following example (see Figure 8-6):
<FORM>
Yes <INPUT type=”radio” name=”yesorno” value=”yes”>
No <INPUT type=”radio” name=”yesorno” value=”no”>
</FORM>

123

124 Part II: Building Better Web Pages

Figure 8-5:
Text box
and text
area.

The name attribute for radio buttons works differently from other INPUT
types. A set of radio buttons has the same name for everything in it; it is the
value attribute that specifies the difference between them. That’s because
there can be only one answer — if you choose Yes, then there’s no possibility
of selecting No, and vice versa.
You would choose check boxes if (say) you’re asking whether a user wants
to subscribe to various magazines. In that case, the visitor may want to order
several (both Time and Newsweek, for example). Here’s how it’s done:
<FORM>
Time <INPUT type=”checkbox” name=”time” value=”subscribe”>
<BR>
<BR>
Newsweek <INPUT type=”checkbox” name=”newsweek”
value=”subscribe”>
</FORM>
Figure 8-7 shows how this looks on a Web browser.

125

126 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
Setting up SELECT and OPTION
What if you have, instead of just a few choices, a whole long list of possible
choices, such as which country a visitor is from? Setting up a form with
dozens of radio buttons would leave your Web page so cluttered and confusing that nobody would want to fill out the form.
Setting up a single SELECT element that has several OPTION elements nested
within it, however, lets you add as many choices as you want — in a very
small space — by using drop-down menus or list boxes.
Here’s a code example that lets visitors choose which continent they’re from:
<FORM>
<SELECT name=”continent”>
<OPTION>North America</OPTION>
<OPTION>South America</OPTION>
<OPTION>Europe </OPTION>
<OPTION>Asia </OPTION>
<OPTION>Africa </OPTION>
<OPTION>Australia</OPTION>
<OPTION>Antarctica</OPTION>
</SELECT>
</FORM>
The SELECT element is not a type of INPUT element, but a separate one, and
both it and the nested OPTION element require closing tags.
Figure 8-8 shows how this works. (I’ve added a second copy in the image, not
reflected in the preceding example, that shows both the original result — a
one-line box with a clickable arrow — and what happens when a user clicks
that arrow: The expanded, complete list of options appears.)
If you don’t want just a single line as in the preceding example, you can use a
list box instead of a drop-down menu. All you have to do is just add one attribute to the SELECT element, called size:
<FORM>
<SELECT name=”continent” size=”4”>
<OPTION>North America</OPTION>
<OPTION>South America</OPTION>
<OPTION>Europe </OPTION>
<OPTION>Asia </OPTION>
<OPTION>Africa </OPTION>
<OPTION>Australia</OPTION>
<OPTION>Antarctica</OPTION>
</SELECT>
</FORM>

Chapter 8: Adding Forms

Figure 8-8:
Selecting
continents.

As you can see in Figure 8-9, four of the choices now show instead of just the
first one. The other choices that aren’t shown are accessed by scrolling.

Submitting the form
After a user is finished filling out the form, the next task is to submit the information so it can be processed. Usually you give the user the means to do this
by adding a Submit button at the bottom of the form, like this:
<FORM>
Time <INPUT type=”checkbox” name=”time” value=”subscribe”>
<BR>
<BR>
Newsweek <INPUT type=”checkbox” name=”newsweek”
value=”subscribe”>
<BR>
<BR>
<INPUT type=”submit” value=”Send me my magazines!”>
</FORM>
Any value you enter for the Submit button will be displayed, as shown in Figure
8-10, and the size of the button will expand automatically to accommodate it.

Chapter 8: Adding Forms

Processing the Form
You’ve seen how a form is designed and how to submit its contents after a
user fills it in, but what do you submit it to? HTML has no form-processing
capabilities at all, so you need to send it to an external program for processing. You’d normally, of course, have that program in mind from the very
beginning and design the form to mesh with it.
Although the various form-processing programs (such as shopping carts)
are written in a variety of programming languages, you don’t need to know
anything about programming in order to use them. Instead, many of them are
hooked up to your Web page by using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI).
There’s nothing mystical or particularly difficult about using the CGI, and I
give you the basics in the section “Adding CGI Scripts,” later in this chapter.
If you’re going to use CGI with your Web pages, first you have to make sure
that you have the capability to do so. This sounds obvious, of course, but
you may or may not have CGI access for your Web site. CGI access means
you can run programs on your Web server that use the Common Gateway
Interface, a method of sending form data from a Web page to an external program for processing.
Okay, yeah, CGI also stands for Computer-Generated Imagery, referring to the
special-effects technology that puts monsters, disasters, and other realistic
animations in Hollywood blockbuster movies. The Common Gateway Interface
may not be as spectacular, but it sure is handy for Web sites.
Nine times out of ten, these programs are kept in a subfolder called cgibin, so your first step is to look to see if you have such a subfolder on your
server. If you do, odds are that you have CGI access, because that subfolder
doesn’t have any other purpose. If it’s there, go ahead and try to use a CGI
program. If you follow all the instructions carefully and the program still
doesn’t work, you may need to have a talk with your network administrator
or ISP.

Why your ISP often won’t help
When your Web site is hosted by the same ISP that you get your Internet
access from, you’ll probably find that it’s not too supportive of your desire

129

130 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
to run CGI scripts. There are a couple of reasons for this, which make good
sense to your ISP but don’t help you at all:
✓ Badly written programs using CGI can represent a security hazard,
poking holes in the normal running of things. Because ISPs want everything to run smoothly and under their control instead of someone else’s,
ISPs tend to frown on this possibility.
✓ Most ISPs don’t really care about your Web site. They’re not bad people,
but they’re mostly in the business of providing Internet access to their
customers, and anything else they have to deal with is just an annoyance that gets in the way of their main job.
If your ISP allows you to run CGI scripts, it may be a painful and expensive
process on your end. I once had an ISP that wanted to approve the scripts in
advance, put them on the server sometime over the next couple of days (it
was apparently too much trouble to allow the paying users to access their
own files and get the job done instantly), and charge me $25 a pop for doing
so. From an ISP’s point of view, that’s reasonable. From my point of view,
it was a definite no-go. For starters, I like to do things right away instead of
taking days to get around to it. On top of that, you often have to monkey with
a CGI script before you get it working just the way you want. Every time I
wanted to make a change, it cost another $25 and set me back a couple more
days.

Finding a CGI provider
Fortunately, many Web space providers do provide you with CGI access. If
you live in a city or large town, you can easily shop around and find a new ISP
that’s on your side, CGI-wise. If not, thanks to the way the Internet works, you
don’t need to deal with your local ISP at all.
You can go with a virtual server or other commercial remote Web-space provider (see Chapter 5 for details), or you can easily find free Web-space providers by using the search engine at FreeWebspace.net. Go to the main page
at www.freewebspace.net and click the Advanced Free Hosting Search
link, or just go straight to www.freewebspace.net/search/power.
shtml, as shown in Figure 8-11. In the search form, select the CGI check box
under Features. Select any other options you desire, and click the Search
button. My test search, using the default options and the CGI check box,
came up with 15 free providers that grant CGI access.

Chapter 8: Adding Forms

Using remotely hosted CGI scripts
The CGI scripts that you use don’t have to reside on the same server that
houses your Web pages. This is good, because CGI scripts are run by the
Web server on which the script is located — and using them puts an added
load on your server, if that’s where you keep them. If you have lots of visitors, the data-processing demands on your server can be pretty strenuous.
If you don’t have your Web site on a dedicated server with plenty of power,
things can get really slow.
When the script is on someone else’s server, however, you don’t have to
worry about the server load. Happily, there are lots of remotely hosted CGI
scripts, which means you can still add their capabilities to your own pages
while avoiding the server-overload problem. Many of the add-ons in this book
are remotely hosted.
Free CGI Resources provides free scripts that work via links to its server. (See
Figure 8-12.) Check out some of them at www.fido7.com/free-cgi.

132 Part II: Building Better Web Pages

provides

scripts that

yours.

Adding CGI Scripts
A CGI script works by taking input from your Web page and sending that
input to an external program for processing. Usually it returns a new Web
page that incorporates the results of that processing. The input is most often
data from a form, but it can sometimes be just a link that a user clicks to activate the program.

Basic techniques
Before you do anything, you have to get the script. Whenever I describe a
script in this book, I provide you with the URL of the site from which you can
download the script. After you have the script, follow these basic steps to
use it:
1. Read the instructions for the script. Let me say that again: Read the
instructions.
After you’ve worked with a few scripts, it’s tempting to just plunge right
ahead without looking. After all, most scripts plug in pretty much the
same way, and often you can get away with skipping the instructions.

Chapter 8: Adding Forms
Of course, that’s also the cause of about 900 percent of the problems
people have with scripts. All it takes is to misunderstand or misinterpret
one little setting, and then the whole script won’t work.
The instructions are often in the standard ReadMe.txt file. Sometimes,
the script doesn’t have a ReadMe file, though, and the instructions
are embedded in the text of the script itself in the form of comments.
(Comments are notes the programmer adds to provide information;
they’re marked so they’re differentiated from the program code and
don’t interfere with the running of the program.)
2. Open the script file in a text editor and make any necessary changes
so that it works with your particular setup. After you do this, save the
modified script.
You may, for example, want to add a list of URLs for a link menu, an
e-mail address to send a message to, or the location of your site’s main
Web page. You don’t have to understand the programming in order to
do this little chore. Just follow the instructions and replace the sample
values in the script with your own values.
If you use a word processor to make the changes, make sure that the
script gets saved as plain text and that the original file extension doesn’t
get changed. You don’t want a bunch of word-processor formatting
codes embedded in the script, which you’ll get if you save the original
plain text as, for example, a Microsoft Word .doc file!
3. Add the HTML code that the script’s instructions say to add to your
Web page.
As with the script, you probably need to change a few sample values to
the actual values. The HTML code is usually nothing more than the location of the CGI program, entered as the action attribute of a form.
4. Upload the script and the modified HTML file to your Web server.
The HTML file goes in the normal HTML folder, and the script goes into
the cgi-bin folder.

Solving problems
The basic techniques described in the preceding section work in almost all
cases, but in some situations, you may need to modify the script a bit more
to get everything working just right.
For example, nearly every script you find assumes your cgi-bin directory is
called cgi-bin. Yours may be simply named cgi, for example. If that’s the
case, you need to change the typical folder references in the script to match
your folder name.

133

134 Part II: Building Better Web Pages
You may also find that the standard file extensions, such as .pl for Perl files,
aren’t allowed in your CGI setup. In that case, you have to change the file
extension to whatever your server demands. A file named search.pl, for
example, may need to be renamed search.cgi.
If you try to run the script and nothing happens, here are some troubleshooting options:
✓ Go back over the instructions and see if you did anything wrong. Nine
times out of ten, it’s something simple but so small and insignificant that
it’s easy to overlook. You may have left out a required comma between
two values, or forgotten a quotation mark. Perhaps you misspelled the
URL of a Web site. Very carefully go over everything you did, and you’ll
usually find the problem.
✓ If the script is fine, make sure that you uploaded all the necessary
files. Some scripts have data files that you must upload along with them
in order for them to work properly.
✓ Check to see that your cgi-bin folder has the correct permissions settings. If you’re not familiar with permissions, ask your ISP to check them
for you.
✓ If all else fails, send an e-mail message to the program’s author
explaining the nature of the problem and ask for help. Because
most of these programs are free, don’t expect too much in the way of
technical support. Nobody can afford to both give away programs and
spend all their time providing free technical support as well. The best
approach is to be polite, perhaps tell the program’s author how much
you want to use the program (if you don’t feel that way about it, you
haven’t come this far) — and be sure you give all the information you
can about the settings you used.

Trying Out Form and Poll Makers
Hardly a day passes without someone announcing the results of some kind
of poll: “Thirty-two percent of city residents prefer smog.” “The For Dummies
nerd’s approval rating climbed by 4 percent in the past week.” “Quantum
physics confuses nine people out of five.” For whatever reason, people are
fascinated by other people’s feelings about different subjects. And people
love to toss in their two bits’ worth whenever they see a survey form. Here
are a few common uses for Web-site survey forms:
✓ Feedback on product quality: “How do you rate our new release?”
✓ Opinions on social issues: “Should we pay more attention to threatened
species?”

Chapter 8: Adding Forms
✓ Preferences between political candidates: “Do you plan to vote
Democrat, Republican, or Independent?”
✓ Requests for new site features: “Check the services you want us to add.”
It’s not just polls, though. The amount and variety of information gathered
via forms on the Web are staggering. Visitor information, prospect inquiries,
and product orders are only a few uses of forms. If the idea of using forms
interests you, but you’re not comfortable with the CGI — that’s short for
Common Gateway Interface — you may want to try out some of the form
makers and processing services described in this section.
A tremendous amount of overlap exists between the folks who offer free
forms and those who offer form-processing services. Many of the form
makers also provide CGI services, although they usually limit them to servicing their own custom forms. A pure form-processing service, however, handles forms that you create on your own. This type of service gives you much
more control and power over your Web site’s content.

Response-O-Matic
Response-O-Matic — which you can find (predictably) at www.response-omatic.com on the Web — is one of the best form-processing firms around,
and it gives you tremendous flexibility. It handles any form you want to throw
at it. Well, okay, it does have a few restrictions. But they’re minimal and
reasonable. You can’t, for example, transmit more than 50K of data with one
form submission. That’s plenty, however, with scads and bunches to spare.
The questions that you add to the form are up to you, but they require a
bit of HTML knowledge. (If you’re totally at sea when it comes to HTML, try
Freedback.com instead.)
To create a form by using Response-O-Matic’s service, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.response-o-matic.com and then click the Get Started
button.
2. On the Sign Up page (see Figure 8-13), enter your name, e-mail
address, and a password.
3. Click the Sign Up button.
You get an e-mail message asking you to confirm your account creation.
Click the link in it.
4. The resulting Form Builder page, shown in Figure 8-14, has a rudimentary form that asks for only a name and an e-mail address.
Don’t fill in the information — it’s just part of the form you’re building
for someone else to fill in.

FormSite.com
FormSite.com (www.formsite.com) is another form maker that, in addition
to creating a variety of general forms, has a specific survey form service. Like
Response-O-Matic (described earlier in the chapter), the service is free if you
accept its accompanying advertising — or you can pop for a few bucks to
get rid of the advertising banners and pick up some extra features, such as
secure forms.
To create a form with FormSite.com, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.formsite.com.
2. Click the Sign Up Free button.
3. Type a username and a password in the appropriate text boxes on the
User Profile form, shown in Figure 8-20.
You can optionally provide your e-mail address.

F

irst off, forget any fears you might have about “being a computer programmer!” The processes I talk about in this chapter are things that
anyone could do; in fact, they’re largely the same kinds of things you already
do on a daily basis, but just don’t realize are basically the same as what programmers think about all the time.
When you use that programming mindset to create Web pages, JavaScript
gives you an advantage: It’s not only specifically designed for use on Web
pages, but because it’s also one of the simplest programming languages
around, you’ll find it much easier to learn than some of the more complex
languages (like C++). Combining JavaScript with HTML creates a further
advantage that goes by the name DHTML (or Dynamic HTML). DHTML is
“dynamic” because it allows you to add a high degree of interactivity —
making your Web pages not just a static grouping of words and images, but a
highly entertaining and useful experience for your visitors.

Principles of Programming
A computer program is nothing more than a list of steps for the machine to
follow when trying to complete some task. You already do that sort of thing
for yourself during the normal course of your life, whether you realize it or
not. If you set out to accomplish something as common as taking your children to visit the community swimming pool, you have to consider a whole

148 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
variety of options: You have to make sure that they have the right kind of
clothing (one kind of variable), that they understand the rules of using the
pool (a set of constants), and so on.
So, let’s set aside all your preconceived notions about how difficult it is to
“do” programming — and admit at the outset that you’ve already been programming all your life.
That said, there’s a caveat (my editor promised me I could use at least one
Latin word in this book). That means “beware” — you need to pay careful
attention to getting your JavaScript just right. I mean, if you dress your kid
wrong for the pool, your life doesn’t crash the way a computer program will.
The difficulty with programming is that the computer is inflexible and understands no shades of gray. It takes effort and experience to think with the
ruthless logic of a computer. However, if you follow the instructions in this
chapter, you’ll be well on your way to mastering that skill.

Constants and variables
There are two kinds of values you’ll be using in JavaScript (or in any other
kind of computer programming): constants (values that never change) and
variables (which change depending on the circumstances). The first kind is
like the dates of Christmas Eve or New Year’s Eve — these will always fall
on the 24th and the 31st of December, no matter what else is going on. The
latter, however, are like Easter — which might fall on a different day in a particular year depending on the circumstances.
The first thing you have to do with a variable is to define it; no variable can
have any value unless, of course, that variable actually exists first. As you’d
imagine, this is a fairly simple affair: To establish that a particular variable
exists, you simply declare that this is so by adding a line like this to your
JavaScript:
var thisvariableexists
If you want to assign a starting value to a variable at the same time that you
declare it to exist, the process is just a tad different:
var thisvariableexists=1
This line of code both declares the existence of a variable called thisvariableexists and assigns to it a value of 1.
You actually don’t have to use the var part at all. Most Web browsers will
understand what you mean if you just say thisvariableexists=1. Even so,
it’s good programming practice to specify exactly what you mean rather than
just leaving things to chance (and maybe hoping that, years later, you’ll
remember exactly what you meant by some nonstandard usage).

Chapter 9: Exploring JavaScript and DHTML
You’ll probably want to use lots of comments or notes of just exactly what
you meant when you entered certain lines of code. To do so in a JavaScript
situation, all you have to do is to use the figures // at the beginning of a line
of code, as in the following example:
//This is a JavaScript comment.
Normally that’s all you need to do — just the double slash lines with nothing
more. However, if a comment requires more space than one line can provide,
you’d use opening and ending tags to specify it, as in the following example:
/*This is an example of
JavaScript code that exceeds several lines.
*/
The opening and ending tags, of course, would be /* and */.
Even if a value will never vary (in which case it’s not technically a true variable) — the date of New Year’s Eve, for example — you can still assign that
value with a var declaration.
Variables can have one of three value types, and those types influence the
kinds of calculations that you can perform based upon them. The first type
(that we’ve already dealt with) is the numeric kind. Numeric values, as their
name implies, are nothing more than numbers: 31 for the end of December,
12 for that month, and so on.
Strings, however, are composed of textual values rather than numerical ones,
and a string (of letters) can have any value that human languages may impute
to it. Thus the string value “December” may have many more possible interpretations than merely that it is 12th in a series of 12. Depending upon the
particular application involved in interpreting that string, it may mean anything from “the month in which Christmas and Hanukkah occur” to “the time
when winter begins.”
In addition to numerical or string values, you’ll have to deal with Boolean
values. This sounds like a fearsome thing, but all it really means is whether
something is or isn’t logically true. (By the way, everything in computing
revolves around this concept; the simplest possible computer program is one
that tells whether or not a light bulb is lit, and the most complex conceivable
3D graphics software is merely a descendant of this sort of statement.)
String values, unlike their numeric or Boolean equivalents, are always
enclosed within quotation marks.

149

150 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
Doing the math
You’ll often need to compare two values for various reasons. Some of these
include:
✓ Seeing which value is higher or lower.
✓ Determining whether a value entered by a user is different from what
was expected (for example, letters instead of numbers).
✓ Taking a particular action based upon the value.
To compare two values to see whether they’re equal, you use the equality
operator, or == (that’s two equal signs, not one). Table 9-1 gives the most
commonly used comparison operators.

Table 9-1

Comparison Operators

Operator

Function

==

Equal to

!=

Not equal to

<

Less than

>

<=

>=

Greater than or equal to

Of course, you’ll have to perform some mathematical operations along the
way. Table 9-2 shows the symbols you use to do them.

Table 9-2

+

Addition

-

Subtraction

*

/

Division

--

Chapter 9: Exploring JavaScript and DHTML
In addition to the obvious numerical comparisons, you also need to manage
logical comparisons, basically asking whether something is logically true
or false. You form these comparisons by using three operators (shown in
Table 9-3).

Table 9-3

Logical Operators

Operator

Function

&&

AND

||

OR

!

NOT

The AND operator compares two things and returns an answer of true if
they’re both true and false if one or both are different. The OR operator
returns a value of true if either value is logically true. NOT, as you might
imagine, tests whether the reverse of the value in question is true.

Branches
You really can’t do much programming without branching. As the name
implies, this is the point where the program flow can follow one path or
another. It’s a pretty simple situation, really. Let’s say you’re going to the grocery; you might intend to buy Cokes, but find that they’re out of stock, so you
buy 7-Up instead — that’s branching. Here’s what it looks like:
if (drinks==Cokes) {
buyThem;
}
else {
buy7Up;
}

Loops
A loop is pretty much what it sounds like — running around in circles. The
reason for doing this is to wait for something to happen before proceeding
with the rest of the steps in a program.

151

152 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
The following example sets up a loop that writes a number called count on a
Web page, and then checks to see whether that number is less than or equal
to 10. Since the variable count begins by being assigned a value of 1, the
loop will continue to run until all the numbers from 1 to 10 have been written:
for (var count=1; count <=10; count++) {
document.write(“count”);
}
If you’re not careful, you might end up creating an infinite loop. This is one
from which there is no possible exit. The result is that your program won’t do
anything but run around that loop forever. For example, if the preceding code
checked to see whether the variable count was a negative number, it would
create an infinite loop because count would always be positive. Always,
always, always make sure there’s a way out of any loop you create.

Creating JavaScript Functions
Okay, if you’ve been following along in this chapter, you’ve had a good look
at what makes a typical JavaScript work. But you still need to see how you
start things off and finish them up.
Although HTML can’t handle program instructions by itself, it gives you a
way (as you might well imagine) to tell it to hand off control of the page to a
JavaScript program. And it’s probably no great shock that you do this neat
trick by using the SCRIPT element.
As with most other HTML elements, this one has both opening and closing
tags, so a typical JavaScript might be encompassed by HTML lines similar to
these:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<SCRIPT>
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
</BODY>
</HTML>

Chapter 9: Exploring JavaScript and DHTML
As you’ve doubtless noticed in the above code example, the SCRIPT element
normally falls within the HEAD element. This is a very important fact —
because the various declarations of values (as we discussed earlier) must
happen before any action upon them is taken. In some rare circumstances,
you might be able to get away with setting a JavaScript within the BODY element, but you’d be taking your chances, to put it mildly.
Whatever falls between the <SCRIPT> and </SCRIPT> tags is up to the
JavaScript to handle. As the possibilities of such an interaction literally
involve an entire programming language and everything it might accomplish
in the minds of all the programmers who exist, they’re inherently infinite.
You, whether or not you realize it at this time, are a part of that infinite interactive possibility. The decisions you make when designing your Web pages
are perhaps only a small part of our global heritage, but each one of them
reaches out to the whole Web as an example of what can be done.

Incorporating JavaScripts
JavaScript has a tremendous advantage over other methods of adding
“beyond-HTML” features to your Web pages. It was designed for no other
purpose, and it’s so tightly integrated with HTML that it’s a joy to use. The
processing takes place in the visitors’ Web browsers, so it’s both fast for
them and no problem for your Web server. You don’t have to understand the
language to add other people’s scripts to your Web site. In many cases, no
alterations to the code are needed. In some cases, you may have to change
the filename or add some URLs to a list. Figure 9-1 shows the JavaScript
Source at http://javascript.internet.com, one of the many places on
the Web to get free JavaScript code.

Basic techniques
You need to add two things to your Web pages when you work with
JavaScript: the script itself and something that triggers the script.

153

154 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff

Figure 9-1:
The
JavaScript
Source

The script
The script has to go in the HEAD element of your Web page, like this skeleton
script named whatever:
<HEAD>
<Script Language=”JavaScript”>
/*
You will usually find comments here.
*/
function whatever()
{
Actual code is found here.
}
</Script>
</HEAD>
You can place scripts within the BODY element rather than the HEAD element, but that can be risky. A JavaScript has to be interpreted — translated
by a Web browser from the human-readable code into something a computer
can understand — before it runs. Scripts in the HEAD element are processed
before the Web browser processes the elements within the BODY element.

Chapter 9: Exploring JavaScript and DHTML
That means these scripts are defined and ready to roll before anything shows
up in the Web browser. If the script is in the BODY element, a visitor may possibly attempt to trigger it before it’s defined, which begs for a malfunction. It’s
better to stick with the safer, usual approach.

The trigger
You need to add something to your Web page to trigger the script, which
causes it to run. This goes within the BODY element. Many things can trigger
a script, but you don’t need to be concerned with all the possibilities. The
script you add is most likely designed to have a particular trigger — say, a
rollover image that changes whenever a visitor’s mouse pointer is over the
image. Or it may be intended to work after the Web page finishes loading into
the browser. You can alter the trigger if you’re familiar with JavaScript. (See
Table 9-4 for a list of such trigger events.)
For a script that executes as soon as the Web page loads into the browser,
use the onload attribute of the BODY element:
<BODY onload=”whatever()”>

Dealing with problems
Fortunately, practically any JavaScript you pick up is pretty much guaranteed
to work — under the right conditions. But with JavaScript, zillions of things
can go wrong. The biggest problem is that so many different versions of Web
browsers are out there. Not only do Firefox and Internet Explorer handle
scripts a little differently, but also different versions of the two major Web
browsers don’t work the same. That means that a script that works fine in
the latest version may not work at all in an older one. Unfortunately, lots of
older Web browsers are still out there — not everyone is in a hurry to tie up
their systems by downloading the newest versions.
If one of your visitors is running some weird Web browser that doesn’t recognize JavaScript, then your script won’t run. There’s no harm done, just a
missed experience for the visitor.
Unless you want to put the time and effort into really mastering the language
and doing your own debugging, your best bet is to simply try out the script
you want to use. Test it in Firefox, Internet Explorer, and any other Web
browser you think your target audience uses. If the script works well in all
the browsers, you’re home free. If it causes problems in any of them, you
have to decide how important that segment of the audience is to you. For
example, if your site is dedicated to Microsoft products and your script won’t
work in Firefox, you’re probably pretty safe in going ahead with it anyway,
because the vast majority of your visitors are likely to use Microsoft Internet
Explorer.

155

156 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
The Document Object Model (DOM)
Most Web pages end up containing a large number of separate elements, and
it can be a daunting task to keep them all in mind. Obviously, when it comes
to combining the complex capabilities of DHTML with a sophisticated Web
page, it would be really, really helpful to have some way of keeping track of
everything that’s on that page, some easy way you could reference all those
elements in your programming.
That’s where the Document Object Model (usually just called DOM for short)
comes in. It establishes a hierarchy in which each and every element can be
referenced by its nested position on the page.
For example, the Web page itself is an object called the document. The attributes of HTML elements are seen in the DOM as properties. Thus, if you
wanted to reference the Web page’s background color, you’d say document.
bgColor. To reference the color of a table on the page, you’d use document.
tableName.bgColor.
The whole process is a flow from top to bottom, not of the physical page,
but of the nesting process. Recall that a Web page is composed of elements
nested within other elements, and this form of notation is simply another
way of looking at that nesting relationship. Thus every element nested within
another element becomes, in the DOM, just another property of the higher
element. The Web page itself, for instance, is a property of the Web browser
(window.document).
I’ll give you several examples of how to use this kind of referencing in your
own JavaScript, but a full exposition of the DOM would take an entire book of
its own. Fortunately, there’s Java & XML For Dummies by Barry Burd (Wiley
Publishing).

Making Choices with JavaScript Events
An event in JavaScript is, as you’d expect, when something happens. Either
directly or indirectly, events are caused by users. When one of your site’s
visitors presses a key, for example, that generates a KeyPress event; when
the visitor lets go of the key, it generates a subsequent KeyUp event.
This gives you a great deal of versatility in your programming efforts.
Depending upon the situation, you can treat the same user action as various
kinds of events.

Chapter 9: Exploring JavaScript and DHTML
Often, what seems to be a single action is actually a series of events — when
someone clicks a link to another page, for example, doing so generates a
Click event (clicking the mouse button) as well as an Unload event (leaving
the Web page).
So how do you handle events? With event handlers. An event handler is
simply any JavaScript that you write that reacts to a particular event. You
use the prefix on to differentiate the event handler from the event; thus, you
handle a Click event with an onClick event handler, a KeyPress event
with an onKeyPress handler, and so on.
If all this sounds a little confusing, just hang in there and don’t forget to consult the handy info in Tables 9-4, 9-5, and 9-6 if you need a little help when
you’re doing your own Web pages.

Load: The page opens in a Web browser.

Mouseovers and clicks
The two most common JavaScript events are the ones you might expect (and
have probably used in your own Web surfing): mouseovers and clicks.
Mouseovers are commonly used to initiate some change in an element, such
as substituting one image for another or altering either the foreground or
background colors. The onMouseOver event handler is used to trigger a
JavaScript when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
The corollary event is onMouseOut, which is used to execute scripts when a
mouse pointer moves away from an element.
No matter what it looks like on the screen, an element is shaped like a
rectangle — and a mouseover will take place when the pointer crosses the
edge of that invisible box that surrounds the element, not when it reaches
the visible part! Likewise, a MouseOut event won’t happen until that invisible
border is crossed.
For a script that requires the visitor to click an element — when they press
and release the left mouse button — use the onClick event handler. This
example uses the A element, but onClick is a ubiquitous attribute that you
can use with just about anything:
<A onClick=”whatever()”>Click here for whatever.</A>
The documentation for a script normally specifies which trigger(s) it’s
intended to use. If you want to explore JavaScript, try JavaScript For
Dummies, 4th Edition, by Emily A. Vander Veer (Wiley Publishing).

Keyboard input
Although the mouse is the most common method of Web interaction, you
can also utilize the keyboard. An instruction to the user to “Press any key”

Chapter 9: Exploring JavaScript and DHTML
enables you to treat that action as three different events, depending upon the
requirements of your particular script.
When a user presses a key and releases it, that’s called (as you might expect)
a KeyPress event. This action can, if needed, be further broken down into a
KeyDown event and a KeyUp event.

Adding Interactive Menus
Although it’s nice to have a program that makes your page do something you
wanted, one of the greatest things you can do with DHTML is to add interactivity to your Web pages — your users become active participants rather than
merely watching some process over which they have no control.
Nearly every program you’ve ever used has some form of menu — a list of
options you can choose from — and they’re a pretty common sight on Web
sites as well. You can choose from a variety of styles; the most common are
either horizontal or vertical.

Making drop-down lists
A drop-down list (shown in Figure 9-2) is easy to add to your site. It’s a form
that contains a selection menu that helps visitors navigate your site. When
a visitor makes a selection from the list, the form calls the appropriate
JavaScript code and loads the selected page.

Figure 9-2:
A JavaScript
drop-down
list menu.

To add this JavaScript to your Web page, first you put the script into your
HEAD element so your code looks like this:
<HEAD>
<SCRIPT language=”JavaScript”>
function golinks(where) {
self.location = where;
}
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>

159

160 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
Of course, you’ll probably have some other stuff in the HEAD element, too
(such as your title), but I’m focusing on the basics here.
Next, put the form into your BODY element:
<BODY>
<FORM>
<SELECT onchange=”golinks(this.options[this.
selectedIndex].value”>
<OPTION value=”http://www.dummies.com/”>
Dummies Press</OPTION>
<OPTION value=”http://www.wiley.com/”>
Wiley Publishing</OPTION>
</SELECT>
</FORM>
</BODY>
Change the values of the OPTION elements to the URLs you want to link to. Of
course, you’ll want to change the descriptive content, too. To add more links
to the list, just add more OPTION elements.

Making a menu with CoffeeCup
You don’t have to tackle coding for all your forays into DHTML. There are
lots of programs that give you a helping hand — including CoffeeCup HTML
Editor, the one we’ve used in other chapters. Of course it allows you to edit
JavaScript just as it does HTML, but it also lets you put together a DHTML
menu quickly and easily. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪CSS Menu Designer from the menu.
This brings up the Menu Designer, shown in Figure 9-3.

Figure 9-3:
The CSS
Menu
Designer.

Chapter 9: Exploring JavaScript and DHTML
2. Under Menu name, type your own name over the default “menu.”
3. Click the Add Root Item button.
In the options under Selected Menu Item, type the text you want to show
in the menu for this choice. Also, enter the URL of the page you want to
link to.
4. Repeat Step 3 for all the menu items you want to add.
Figure 9-4 shows what the situation looks like when the same options
are added that were used in the preceding JavaScript example.

Figure 9-4:
A basic
menu structure with
two options.

5. To add items beneath the root options in the menu’s hierarchy, select
the desired root item and then click the Add Subitem button.
You can only add three levels of subitems, as shown in Figure 9-5.

Figure 9-5:
Adding
subitems.

161

162 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
6. To delete a menu choice, select it and click the Delete Item button.
7. To add more items on the same level (rather than as subitems), select
a menu option, then click the Add Sibling button (see Figure 9-6).

Figure 9-6:
Adding sibling items.

8. Click the Preview button to see how your efforts so far will look on a
Web page (see Figure 9-7).

Figure 9-7:

9. To specify colors to use, click the Menu Colors tab, shown in
Figure 9-8.

Figure 9-8:
The Menu
Colors tab.

10. Under Main Menu Colors, click the arrow to the right of the color box
to access a color chart (see Figure 9-9).
These options let you set the colors for the menu items’ background,
border, and font. In addition, you can set the background and font
colors that will be shown when a MouseOver event occurs.
If you like, you can also simply type a hexadecimal color value into the
text box to the right of any of the options.

Figure 9-9:
Selecting a

If you don’t want to specify different colors for the submenu items, just
click the Use Main Menu Colors button.
Use the Preview button any time you make a color change to make sure
the results are exactly what you want.
13. Click the Options tab (shown in Figure 9-11).

Figure 9-11:

14. Under Orientation, select either Horizontal or Vertical.
Figure 9-12 shows the results of changing the example from the default
horizontal orientation to a vertical one.

15. Set the margins (the distance between the edge of the menu and the
top or edge of the Web page) by either typing directly into the text
box to the right of Margin Top and Margin Left or using the arrows to
scroll up and down.
Although it’s possible to enter negative numbers here, the results can be
unattractive, moving portions of the menu out of sight.
16. Set the Border Width the same way; you can only use values from 0 to
20 here.
17. Under Menu Items, click the A button to access a list of available fonts
(see Figure 9-13).

18. Select a size for the font by scrolling. Click the B and I buttons to
make the font bold and italic, respectively.
19. Under Alignment, select Left, Center, or Right for both the Menu Text
and Submenu Text.
20. Set the amount of padding in pixels for both the top and left.
Just as with table cells (see Chapter 3), this specifies the amount of
space between the edges of the menu item and the text it contains.
21. If you want all menu items to be the same size regardless of their content, be sure to select the Use Fixed Width for Menu Items check box;
then specify a size (in pixels) in the Item Width entry.
You’ll want to use the Preview button to see whether this choice makes
the menu unreadable!
22. Click the OK button to complete your menu.

Buttons and Image Maps
In This Chapter

A

lthough it’s true that you can do all kinds of stuff with just plain old
textual methods — as detailed in the various chapters surrounding this
one — there’s nothing like an image to nail things down in the minds of your
site’s visitors.
It would be unimaginable to attempt to publish a newspaper or magazine
with no photos or artwork — and it’s a rare book indeed that goes to press
without a single illustration of any kind. The reason for this is very simple —
a picture is worth a thousand words. For Web pages, this old saying is true
a million times over (so a Web image must be worth a billion words, right?).
Higher math aside, you need to consider the graphical nature of your pages
as well as their textual content if you want to succeed in the most competitive market the world has ever known.
When I speak of the graphical nature of your Web pages, I’m not just talking about tossing in a photo of the latest scandal-ridden celeb somewhere
between a couple of paragraphs of text. What you need here is to focus,
right from the git-go, on making your pages attractive to your visitors’ visual
needs. People have a natural response to symbols, shapes, and colors. Even
something as simple as a stop sign has much more to it than that single word
STOP — its shape and color also help define it. The same is true of the contents of your Web pages.
That means you need to give some serious thought to how you present (say)
menu options and links. You could just take the easy way out and settle for
some simple text that’s blue and underlined, but your pages are going to look

170 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
a whole lot better if you take the time to add some fancy-looking buttons
instead. All by itself, that’ll take you a long way, but this chapter also delves
into the mysteries of using image maps, which are images that contain several links that are activated by clicking different parts of the image. Just like it
sounds, they’re often composed of traditional maps just like you’d find in any
atlas, but you don’t have to settle for any traditional approaches. Hey, this
is the Web we’re talking about, and anything goes — the only limit is your
imagination.
So come along and get a look at the basics of how these things are done.
Beyond that, let your creativity soar!

Creating Buttons
Two kinds of people make buttons for Web pages — professional artists and
the rest of us. If you’re the first kind, you’ve probably already dashed out a
couple of dozen prototypes in a variety of styles while you were reading this
paragraph. If you’re the second kind, then you’re not alone if you need a little
help.
If you want some buttons fast (and your best efforts with programs like
Photoshop leave a wee bit to be desired), try surfing over to CoolText.com
at — you guessed it — www.cooltext.com. This Web site generates graphics, according to the options that you choose, while you wait. The process is
simple and fun, and there’s no limit to the number of logos you can experiment with.
Not only are its logos cool, but so are the site’s legal requirements: none, zip,
nada. There’s no copyright issue to deal with, no ads stuck in the middle of
things, and no fine print of any kind. As an act of gratitude for such a great
service, you may want to add a link back to this site from yours, but even
that’s not required.
Although CoolText.com doesn’t hold a copyright on the logos you create, you
probably do. I’m not a lawyer (and I don’t even play one on TV), but it seems
to me that the decisions you make during the course of designing the logos
qualify them as artistic creations. Don’t take my word for it, though. If this
point is important for your situation, check with an attorney who really knows
copyright law, or e-mail the U.S. Copyright Office at copyinfo@loc.gov.

Creating Image Maps
Although Chapter 2 introduces using links with images, you can also use a
special kind of image link called an image map. If you use a normal image link,
you’re limited to a single link that goes with a single image. By using image
mapping, however, you can add several links to a single image.
When you use an image-mapping program, you draw shapes over specific
areas within an existing image. You then assign a particular URL to each of
these areas. When visitors click the part of the image that links to that URL,
they’re sent to it immediately.
You may, for example, use a map of the world as your image map. When
your visitors click England or Scotland, they go to a page about the United
Kingdom. If they click Africa, they go to a page about that continent. And so
on and so forth . . .
You don’t need to stay purely geographical, either. You can just as easily take
a diagram of the human body and set up an image map where users click the
abdomen to go to a page about appendectomies or click the mouth to go to
a page about dentistry. Any kind of logical connection you can come up with
will work as an image map.

177

178 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
Many Web-design programs include image-mapping features; you get to try
out the ones in CoffeeCup’s HTML designer here (the same company has a
stand-alone image program called Image Mapper as well). Many graphics
programs, such as Fireworks, also include image-mapping capabilities. If you
don’t own one of those programs, you may want to check out some of the
image-mapping programs listed in Table 10-1.
Here’s how to add an image map to a page you’re working on in CoffeeCup
HTML Editor:
1. Choose Tools➪Image Map from the menu.
2. Make sure that Create a New Image Map is selected (see Figure 10-9),
then click the Next button.

Figure 10-9:
Starting a
new image
map.

3. Click the Browse button, select the image you want to use as the basis
for your image map (see Figure 10-10), and then click the Next button.

Figure 10-10:

Chapter 10: Adding Image-Based Buttons and Image Maps
4. If you want to change the name of the map, do so in the dialog box
that appears now (see Figure 10-11); by default, the map name is the
same as the filename.
Optionally, you can enter a URL that will be accessed if a user clicks
somewhere outside the defined areas you will create on the image map
(you may or may not decide to create such an area). If you’re using
frames, select the frame in which you want to open the linked page.
Click the Next button.

Figure 10-11:
First options.

5. In the succeeding dialog box, click the Finish button. The image now
opens in the Image Mapper, as shown in Figure 10-12.
6. Choose the type of geometric figure best suited to your image-mapping needs — rectangle, circle, or polygon — by clicking the appropriate icon on the upper-left side of the Image Mapper (see Figure 10-13).
Because the borders of the various United States can’t be outlined as
either a rectangle or a circle, I’m using the polygon tool, which lets me
draw my own shapes.
7. Click at a starting point, move the mouse pointer to the farthest point
you can while following the border, and then click again. Continue
to do so until you have outlined everything you want to make into a
clickable area.
In this example, I clicked the northwestern corner of California first
(where it meets Oregon at the Pacific Ocean), then the northeastern
corner, down to the bend, and I continued clicking at each turn until I
had returned to my starting point.

8. When you’ve completed the circuit, double-click to finish the area.
You should now have something that looks like the image map shown
in Figure 10-14.
9. Under Area Properties, enter a name for the area and the URL you want
your visitors to go to when they click that area (see Figure 10-15).
10. Optionally, enter Alt Text that will show if the image map is unavailable.
11. If using frames, select the target frame from the drop-down list.

eb pages don’t just sit there anymore. They’ve come a long way since
the early stages of just displaying text on your computer screen. New
forms of multimedia experiences crop up all the time. Television and radio
stations, for example, have broadcast on the Web for a long time, but most
of them target only individual users; few of these broadcasters have realized
the importance of allying with Webmasters to get more exposure for their
signals. I dug up a few sites for you that are Web-based themselves, existing
only on the Web instead of being traditional broadcast or cable stations —
and they do understand how much you, the Webmaster, mean to them.
I also point you to plenty of sources for sound files that you can use on your
Web site. Of course, as with any innovation, there’s a certain amount of
debate about the use of sound on Web pages. Aside from the carping of diehard traditionalists who just plain insist that you shouldn’t use it, there are
some serious considerations. Sound doesn’t necessarily go with every site.
If you decide to use it, you need to match the mood of the music with the
page’s theme. The right song can add a new dimension; the wrong one can
sound ridiculous — and maybe even make your site a bit of a joke.

If you use sound, make sure that you give your visitors a way to turn it off.
Embedded sound with no controls is an annoyance to many visitors. You may
as well give them the option; otherwise they can simply turn off their speakers
to get rid of the sound (or just leave your site in disgust, never to return).

184 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
Getting Music and Video
First things first: You gotta get hold of the music or whatever media content
before you can add it to your Web site. Okay, grabbing music off the Web, off
a newsgroup, through FTP, or just about any other way that data moves on
the Internet is a pretty easy thing to do. However, you face two problems with
taking just any old song that you can get your hands on — and the same goes
for video. First, if you can snag it with no trouble, so can everyone else — and
you presumably want your site to stand out from the crowd. Second, you face
the question of copyright. The odds are pretty good that you have no idea who
owns the copyright to a song or video that you snag from some Web site — or
whether it’s in the public domain (legally available for everyone to use) instead
of under copyright.
You can avoid this copyright mess by following these few simple suggestions:
✓ Get your own custom music or video by hiring professionals to create
it for you — totally new and completely unencumbered. That way, you
won’t have any legal hassles, and nobody else can use it legally on
another site.
✓ Buy or download royalty-free music and video collections.
✓ Use public-domain music and video (if you don’t mind everyone else
using the same music or video on countless other Web sites, too).
✓ Create your own music or video.
The following sections describe how to get these different types of files for
your site.

Finding music houses
Professional music suppliers can accommodate your desires to play unique
music on your site, either by selling you custom compositions that they
design to serve your particular needs or by providing you with music they
already have on hand for you to buy or license. The exact deal you strike
depends on the company’s policy — and on how much money you’re willing
to part with. Some companies license you to use the music only in certain
ways (sort of like the way software licenses say things like you can use a
program on only a single computer). So when you talk to them, be sure to
specify that the music will be used on Web pages. You shouldn’t, however,
have to pay any royalties — fees for every time you play the music — just the
flat fee when you get the music.

Chapter 11: Web Sights and Sounds
LicenseMusic.com (shown in Figure 11-1) is one good source that sports a
useful database of what’s available. Table 11-1 lists some other good Web
sites where you can find or order royalty-free music.

186 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
Finding public-domain music and video
Not all music or video is currently under copyright. Music has been around
a lot more than 80 years, so most of it’s in the public domain — meaning
that nobody holds the copyright to it. The reverse is true of video. Video is
a more recent technology, and the massive proliferation of compact, lightweight video cameras means that most moving pictures have been created
within the past few years.
Copyright can prove to be a tricky issue. If you make a mistake, you can
end up in federal court, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.
Rest assured, however, that very few copyright infringers ever go to prison,
although the law provides for that eventuality. On the other hand, some of
these copyright infringers find themselves spending all their time talking
to lawyers — and paying lawyers. So before you add some public-domain
music or video to your Web site, make absolutely sure that it is in the public
domain.
Table 11-2 lists some good public-domain music and video sources.

Downloads.html

Some public-domain music sites provide copies of sheet music that you can
use to create new recordings of your own. Others have music files that you
can download and use right away. There’s a catch, however; a recording of

Chapter 11: Web Sights and Sounds
a public-domain song is not, itself, in the public domain. The written music
is, but the recording isn’t. Yes, I’m repeating myself, but it’s critical for you
to remember that. The legal reasons are so convoluted that any two lawyers
have three opinions about why it’s so, but it’s a fact. So unless the site specifically states that it’s releasing its music files into the public domain, you probably have to pay for the download. Some sites that charge commercial sites to
use their recordings are willing to let noncommercial sites use them for free.

Picking a File Format
Your main concern when choosing a file format for either Web audio or Web
video is download time — the length of time it takes for a Web site visitor to
be able to experience the music or movie. Most people won’t be willing to go
make a sandwich to pass the time waiting to hear a favorite song, and even
your dearest friends may not be happy about spending all afternoon trying to
see the video of your vacation.
Three main factors affect download time: the speed of the network connection, the file size, and whether the file has to completely download in order to
start playing. No matter how fast your Web server’s connection is, you have
no control over the speed of your visitors’ connections. Thus the only thing
you can really do is modify either the file size or the manner in which the file
is displayed.
I deal with file compression in the following section, so now I want to take
a look at streaming versus regular files. With a regular file, such as the MP3
format that is so popular for reproducing music, the entire file must be downloaded and then played. With a streaming file, such as Real Audio, the user
can hear the first part of the music while the rest of it is still on the way.
In theory, it sounds like a great idea. Sometimes, though, streaming files
(whether with video or audio content) can be jerky and aesthetically deficient, especially with slower connections. So you have to decide whether
speed of display is more important to you than smoothness of presentation.
Tables 11-3 and 11-4 show some commonly used video and audio file formats,
a description of each, and whether each format is streamable.

To experiment with various settings and see how they affect file size, follow
these steps:
1. In Windows Movie Maker, select a movie by clicking its icon. (See
Figure 11-2.)
2. Click the Save to My Computer link on the left side of the screen.
The Save Movie Wizard appears, shown in Figure 11-3.
3. Enter a filename for your movie in the first text box.
4. If you don’t want to save your videos in the My Videos folder, the
default setting in the second text box, click the Browse button and
choose a different location.
5. Click the Next button.
On the next page, the default setting Best Quality for Playback on My
Computer is selected, as shown in Figure 11-4.
6. Before checking out the other options, take a moment to look over the
values in Setting Details and note the estimated file sizes those settings generate.

7. If you want to go with the default setting, skip ahead to Step 10.
Otherwise, click the Show More Choices link to see additional options.
8. If you have a particular file size in mind as your target, select the Best
Fit to File Size option button and then either enter the value or scroll
up or down until you find it. You can set the target file size in either K
(kilobytes) or MB (megabytes).
As you set different values for the target size, only one of the values in
Setting Details changes: Bit Rate. This setting determines the amount of
information included in the file. A lower bit rate means a lower quality of
video and a smaller file size; a higher bit rate means the reverse.
9. Select the Other Settings option button, as shown in Figure 11-5. From
the drop-down list next to it, select various settings and observe the
impact on the values in Setting Details.

Figure 11-5:

The Video for Broadband option, for example, sets a bit rate of 512
Kbps, a display size of 320 x 240 pixels, and a replay rate of 30 frames
per second, generating a 260K file. The Video for Dial-Up Access option,
on the other hand, sets a bit rate of only 38 Kbps, a display size of 160 x
120 pixels, and a replay rate of 15 frames per second, resulting in a file
that takes up only 20 kilobytes.
10. After you’ve arranged the settings to your satisfaction, click the Next
button.
The file is saved.
11. Click the Finish button to close the Save Movie Wizard.

Chapter 11: Web Sights and Sounds

Adding Audio and Video
Files to Your Site
You put both audio and video files on your Web page in the same way — or
ways, rather. The simplest way to do it is the same way you connect any file
to a Web page. Just put in a link for visitors to click, something like this one:
<a href=”videofile.mpg”>Click here to see the
vacation video.</a>
Depending upon a particular visitor’s system and configuration, the link to
the video or sound file will cause different responses when clicked. It may
work right in the browser. It may have to launch an external application to
play the file. It may prompt the visitor to download the file. And so on. The
one thing that won’t happen is the seamless integration of the file into your
Web page.
If you’d like to make that happen, use the EMBED element. Here’s the basic
setup:
<embed src=”musicfile.mid” width=”300” height=”100”>
</embed>
You may want to pay attention to a few other attributes besides width and
height. The most important of these is autostart, which does what you’d
expect: It starts the music or video playing automatically. Just alter the code
so it reads like this:
<embed src=”musicfile.mid” width=”300” height=”100”
autostart=”true”>
</embed>
The other useful attribute is loop, which specifies whether the file will play
more than once and, if so, how many times. To set it to play over and over
again, just enter this code:
<embed src=”musicfile.mid” width=”300” height=”100”
autostart=”true” loop=”true”>
</embed>
To specify how many times to loop, just use the number instead of the word
true. Here’s an example:
<embed src=”musicfile.mid” width=”300” height=”100”
autostart=”true” loop=”3”>
</embed>

Adding a Flash music player
When it comes to adding sound, you can get a lot more sophisticated than
plain old HTML. Sound players based in Adobe Flash, for example, let you
seamlessly integrate everything from your MP3s to your own recordings into
your Web site.
What if you aren’t a Flash wizard or you just don’t want to spend that kind
of money to get started? No problem — lots of programs let you create your
own Flash-based players with little effort or no investment.
One of the tops on my list is the Website Music Player. Here’s how easy it is
to use:
1. Go to http://download.cnet.com/Website-MusicPlayer/3000-2168_4-10512716.html?tag=mncol, download the
Website Music Player, and unzip it.
2. Check with your Web service provider to make sure you have PHP
available (that’s a common Web scripting language, so you probably
do).
3. Upload the files musicplayer.swf, playlist.php, and musicplayer.js to your Web site’s main folder (the same place your home
page is).
4. Make a folder named mp3 in your main folder and upload your mp3
files into it.
5. Add the following HTML code to your Web page:
<table align=”center” border=”0” cellspacing=”0”cellpadding=”0”><tbody><tr
><td>
<div align=”center”>
<script language=’JavaScript’ src=’musicplayer.js’ type=’text/
javascript’></script></div>
<tr><td><div align=”center”><font face=”Arial”
font size=”1”><a href=”http://www.websitemusicplayer.com”
target=”_blank”>website music player</a></font></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Your Web page will now show the player as shown in Figure 11-6.

Importing YouTube video
YouTube (www.youtube.com) is one of the hottest sources of videos on the
Web. Although you can use some services such as keepvid.com or youtube
catcher.com to download a video, it’s easier to just either link to it or embed
it. To link to it, simply copy the address in the URL text box and add it as a
link in your site. (See the code samples in the “Adding Audio and Video Files
to Your Site” section, earlier in this chapter.)
Fortunately, the embedding process is about as easy as it can possibly be.
YouTube gives you the source code for it right next to every video. (See
Figure 11-7.) All you have to do is click in the Embed text box, which automatically selects the whole thing, and then copy the code and paste it into
your own Web page.

Figure 11-7:
The Embed
text box
contains the
code you
need.

The Embed text box

YouTube uses both the <object> and the <embed> elements for embedding
video. This makes sure that the video will display in any Web browser.

Adding a Blog
In This Chapter
▶ Constructing blogs with Blogger
▶ Blogging with WordPress

B

logs (or ’blogs, if you want to get technical) are Web logs — essentially,
a way for you to alter the content of your Web site at will. Blogs cover a
wide range of content, from daily diaries to professional journalism, and their
popularity seems to know no bounds.
You can use blogging technology to keep your site updated without having to
get into coding — and you can make changes while you’re on the road, away
from your design computer. Just drop into an Internet café, go online, fill out
an electronic form — and your site is updated right away.

Adding Blogger to Your Site
Blogger — another Google Web service — is perhaps the most popular Web
log provider and one of the easiest to use. To get started, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.blogger.com and click the Create A Blog button (see
Figure 12-1).
2. You need to create a Google account to use Blogger.com; to do so,
enter your e-mail address, your password twice, and the name you
want as your blog signature. If you don’t want to receive e-mails relating to Blogger, deselect the E-mail Notification check box. Enter your
birthday and the Word Verification. Select the I Accept the Terms of
Service check box, and click the Continue button (see Figure 12-2).
3. Click the Continue button.
4. Enter a name for your blog in the Blog Title box (see Figure 12-3).
Enter a subdomain name in the Blog Address (URL) box. Also, do the
word verification (this tells Google you’re a human being).

Chapter 12: Adding a Blog
This has nothing to do with the URL of your own Web site. It’s to establish the URL on Blogger where your blog will be hosted on Google’s servers. You’ll get a chance to specify your own site’s URL later on. If your
blog is called, say, CelebNews, you’d enter that name as the subdomain
on Google.
5. Click the Continue button.
The Choose a Template page appears, as shown in Figure 12-4.
6. Select the option button under the design you like best.
Regardless of which template you pick, you can change it later.

7. Click the Continue button.
Your new blog is created.
8. Click the Advanced Setup Options link, which causes two new links to
appear, as shown in Figure 12-5.
9. Click the Set Up a Custom Domain link.
This takes you to a page (see Figure 12-6) where Google offers to sell
you a domain. As you already have one, click the link on the right that
says Switch to Advanced Settings. The page now changes so it looks like
Figure 12-7.
10. Enter the URL of your domain, complete the word verification, and
(finally) click the Save Settings button.
The Use a Missing Files Host option is used if you have two different
sources for the files in your blog (which most people don’t bother with,
of course). If you’re one of the rare ones, select this option and specify
the location of your backup blog files.
If everything went well, then you’ll see a page showing your settings and
saying at the top that Settings Were Saved Successfully.
11. Click the Posting tab (see Figure 12-8) and you’re ready to start blogging on your site. Enter either some prepared material or just any old
thing that comes to mind.

12. Click the Preview link.
13. If you don’t like what you see, you can click the Hide Preview link
and go back to the drawing board. If you’re satisfied, click the Publish
Post button instead.
You’re done.

Bloggin’ with WordPress
Although Blogger (see the preceding section) is hosted on Google’s servers,
WordPress is an open-source blogging program that resides on your own
Web server. There are pluses and minuses to both approaches. Of course,
any software that runs on someone else’s server is software that reduces the
load on your own server, but it’s also software that you have (of course) less
control over. In such a case, you need to be sure that you can trust the provider to give you good service; with Google, however, you can count on one
of the most reliable companies around.
The odds are very good that your Web service provider already has the prerequisite software needed to run WordPress, but you might want to doublecheck — before you commit to using it — that both PHP and MySQL are a
part of your service.
Before you decide to install WordPress yourself, check with your Web provider. Your provider might do it for you as part of their basic service because
it’s such a popular program and they get a lot of requests for it. Many providers even offer automated installation of WordPress; check out the options on
your Webmaster’s control panel and see if that’s included.
Here’s the easy process for how to get and install WordPress:
1. Go to wordpress.org and click the Download WordPress button.
On the following page (believe it or not), click the same button again
(gotta love redundancy).
2. Once the .zip file is downloaded, extract its contents into a folder.
3. Upload the folder’s contents to your Web server.
4. Create a MySQL database on your Web server.
Normally, this is a simple matter of clicking a link or button on your Web
service provider’s control panel that says something along the lines
of “Manage MySQL Databases,” then another on a new page that says
“Create MySQL Database.” All you do then is to give it a name of your
choice. If the situation is more complicated, you might want to consider
changing providers!

205

206 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
If you have any doubts or hesitations about how to proceed or exactly
what information is required on your system, check with your Web service provider. No matter how strange something may seem to you,
they’ve probably dealt with it a thousand times; don’t be too surprised if
they get you the answer right away.
5. Surf with your Web browser to the location where you’ve installed the
WordPress files and open the install.php file (for example, www.
yourownsite.com/wp-admin/install.php).
6. Enter the requested data (such as the name of the database you created in Step 4) and your MySQL user name, then click the Submit
button.
Again, if you don’t know these, just ask your provider.
7. You’re asked to enter a title for your blog and your e-mail address.
When you’ve done so, click the Install WordPress button and you’re
done. Just log in to get started.
When you’ve got WordPress installed on your system, you can modify things
to suit your own particular needs. Figure 12-9 shows the WordPress “dashboard” from which you control things.

Figure 12-9:
The
WordPress
dashboard.

Chapter 12: Adding a Blog
There’s a default posting that you may want to view; if you want to read the
whole thing, just click the View All button in that message. Otherwise, move
your mouse pointer over it until a series of options appears below the posting and click the Delete link.

Adding a post in WordPress
The fastest way to add a new post is to use the QuickPress option on the
upper-right side. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Enter a title for your post in, of course, the Title box.
2. Type a message in the text area labeled Content.
3. If desired, you can add a tag — that is, a keyword. Although this
isn’t required, it gives potential readers a quick and easy way to see
whether the content of your blog is their particular cup of tea.
4. If you want to send this post to your blog immediately, click the Publish
button. To save it for later editing, click the Save Draft button instead.
If you choose the latter option, you can click the Preview Post link
(which won’t exist until you save a draft) to see what your post will look
like, as shown in the example shown in Figure 12-10.

Figure 12-10:
Previewing
a draft.

207

208 Part III: Adding Frills and Fancy Stuff
You’ve also doubtless noted the series of Upload/Insert buttons above the
Content area. These are for the purpose of adding multimedia content to
your posts. There are four options: Add an Image, Add Video, Add Audio,
and Add Media. Clicking any of these brings up a dialog box where you can
select files residing on your own computer (via the From Computer tab, of
course), from some site on the Web (via the From URL tab as shown in Figure
12-11), or from the Media Library tab (a listing of all the media you have so
far accessed from whatever source).

Figure 12-11:
Adding an
image from
the Web.

Altering the General Settings
Of course, you’ll probably want to monkey with your default blog settings in
order to integrate your blog as properly as possible into your own Web site.
To do so, click the General link in the Settings menu on the bottom left side of
your screen.
You’ll then see a page showing the current settings (see Figure 12-12). On
this page, you can replace such generic values as “Weblog title” with something like “My Politics Blog,” “I Don’t Like Angry Walruses,” or whatever suits
your nature. You will probably also want to replace the default “Just another
WordPress weblog” tagline text with something more applicable to your
site’s purposes.

Chapter 12: Adding a Blog

Figure 12-12:
The General
Settings
page.

Don’t even think about replacing the URLs in the WordPress address or Blog
address settings! These are standardized and your blog won’t work if you do.
As for the rest of the settings here, you’ll probably want to click the Anyone
Can Register check box under “Membership,” as well as set the appropriate
time zone (the default installation missed mine by two hours, for example).
Feel free to set the date and time formats for whatever system you’re most
comfortable with and to reset the “Week Starts On” setting from the default
of Monday to Sunday.
When you’re done fiddling with these options, just click the Save Changes
button to make them permanent.

earch sites (also called search engines) such as Google are a critical part
of the World Wide Web. Without them, it’s nearly impossible for most
people to find what they’re looking for. Therefore, if you’re serious about
your Web site (and I assume you are because you’re reading this book), it’s
important to know as much about search sites as possible (such as by handson, real-life experiences). And you can’t do much better than trying out the
search sites yourself. You can find out which ones give helpful responses to
your queries and which ones return nonsense. For even more info, check out
Search Engine Optimization For Dummies, by Peter Kent (Wiley Publishing),
which goes into very fine detail about what readers can do to get their sites
listed in the search engines.
Table 13-1 lists the major search sites.

If you’re tired of slow search response times, try AlltheWeb. It gives you
answers so fast that your head spins.
To make sure that people know your Web site exists, you should have it
listed in lots of search engines. How many you should list it in is a matter of
opinion. There’s certainly no harm in going for broke and listing your site
with every search engine, but about a zillion of them are out there — and
most of them aren’t nearly as well known as Yahoo! or Google. In my opinion,
after you’re listed with all the ones in Table 13-1, any more effort runs into
the law of diminishing returns. Yes, you will generate more visits by listing
your site at even more search sites, but you don’t get anywhere near as many
visits from obscure search sites as you do from the more popular ones.
Speaking of popularity, the number one search engine is the oddly named
but fantastically functional Google (www.google.com). Not that it needs the
push, but I highly recommend it. If your site isn’t listed on Google, you’ll miss
out on a lot of potential visitors.
There are many reasons for Google’s success, but the main one is simply that
it gives better results than many of its competitors. This is in large part due
to its sophisticated page-analysis software, and you would do well to keep in
mind what it looks for when you design your site’s pages. Here are some tips
on how to do that:
✓ Make sure that the important terms describing your site (the ones you
think people will use as search terms when they’re hunting for information on Google) appear in both your page title and in the first paragraph
of your Web page.

Chapter 13: Attracting an Audience: Publicizing Your Site
✓ Use the same words at least a few times elsewhere on the page, but
don’t go hog wild — if you overdo it, you’ll lower your ranking.
✓ Break up your page’s text by using heading elements (H1, H2, and so on)
that contain key phrases. Google pays more attention to these than to
normal text.
✓ If, for some reason, your page design can’t utilize heading elements, use
the B (bold text) element to emphasize your keywords. (The STRONG element does the same thing.)
✓ Exchange links with other Webmasters, especially with those who
already have a high Google ranking.
Using search sites isn’t the only way of getting the word out. You can also
work out reciprocal link arrangements with other Web sites, either on a personal level or through the agency of a banner-link exchange. (See the section
“Investigating Reciprocal Linking,” later in this chapter.)

Working Keywords into Your Pages
Search sites have different ways of gathering information on the content of
Web sites:
✓ Some search sites are put together by human effort. People visit Web
sites that have been submitted to the search site and then manually categorize those sites.
✓ Other search sites are fully automated. Programs called robots or spiders
surf the Web, cataloging their findings and adding Web pages to the
search site’s database. Robots and spiders don’t just note the URL of
a page, though. They also index all the words on the page (except for
words like a, an, the, for, and so on).
When someone runs a search, the search terms are compared with the
indexed words. Links to whatever sites match the search terms are then
shown to the person doing the searching.
In addition to the words in the text of your page (and sometimes in the alt
text fields of images and other elements as well), search engines also index
meta keywords.
The following sections give you the lowdown on incorporating keywords into
your site.

215

216 Part IV: Making Money
Adding meta tags
META is one of the most versatile elements in HTML because it’s one of the
most poorly defined ones. Some would just say it doesn’t have many limits.
Its name and content attributes enable you to put many types of information into your HTML documents.
META always goes within the HEAD element, and it has no end tag.
You can have all the META elements you want, but only two of its uses matter
to a search engine: as a page description and as a list of keywords. Neither
one is essential. In fact, despite the frenzy about META keywords, your page
description and TITLE element are actually more useful for search engines.
(Google, the most successful search engine, doesn’t even look at META
keywords.)

Page description
When someone performs a search that returns a hit to your site, the
response usually shows your page title and a blurb of text from the beginning
of your page. This response underscores the importance of a good title. If the
first sentence of your page doesn’t describe all its contents, that may not be
the best possible enticement for someone to visit it. If your page has a META
description, however, the search engine will use that description to — you
guessed it — describe your page.
Imagine that you have a page titled “The Love Letters of Grover Cleveland.”
Well, that title may not mean much to a lot of folks, and if the first sentence
is something like a tame quotation from one of those letters, you’re not doing
too well. But a good description like this can fix that:
<META name=”description” content=”The secret life of the
24th President”>

List of keywords
You add keywords in much the same way that you add a description:
<META name=”keywords” content=”Grover Cleveland, 24th
President, Buffalo, New York, Mugwumps”>
Mugwumps? Trust me — it’s a Grover Cleveland thing.
The META keywords aren’t that important because the content of the page
itself should already have the important terms in it. And some search engines
don’t even look at META keywords. Where keywords are useful is in a special

Chapter 13: Attracting an Audience: Publicizing Your Site
situation that you can’t easily accommodate in the visible page content without looking silly: You need to intentionally misspell words.
It’s a fact: Lots of people have trouble spelling or typing or both. Therefore
you should also add common spelling errors to your list of keywords. For
example, if you list flying saucers and someone’s looking for flying sossers, that
person won’t be able to find your site. (Well, okay, you may not want that
person to find you, but I’m not going to get into that.) You should also cover
yourself for any legitimate spelling variants. For example, if you sell tires and
don’t want to miss out on the British market, you should also list tyres among
your keywords.
When it comes to choosing keywords, don’t neglect synonyms. One person
may look for car parts while another searches for automotive accessories.

Incorporating keywords in the content
The actual content of your Web pages is much more important than META
keywords. In fact, it’s critical — to both your search-engine ranking and visitor retention. When you write the copy for your pages, make sure that you
throw in as many terms as possible that accurately describe your topic. As
far as the search engines are concerned, the more often you can reasonably
include relevant keywords, the better. After all, search engines rank your
Web site by how well the contents of your pages match up with the search
term that someone enters.
When it comes to the human visitors to your pages, as opposed to the
robotic visitors, you need to write in a way that entertains your audience. As
a professional writer, I always try to avoid using the same phrase too often.
When I need to refer to the same thing or action over and over again, I strive
to find new ways to say it. I practically live for synonyms and pronouns.
It can be a difficult balancing act to satisfy your human visitors while at the
same time catering to the search engines’ needs. You don’t want to bore your
readers by endlessly repeating the same terms, but you do want to nail down
the ranking you deserve. Here are some general steps on how to do this:
1. To start with, make up a list of terms that you think people might use
if they search for your page.
2. Go ahead and write your content without paying any attention to your
list.
Writing your content first is important because if you stare at your list of
terms while you’re working, you may stifle your creativity.

217

218 Part IV: Making Money
3. After you’ve finished writing your page, look over the list and mark
down how many times you’ve used each of the terms on the page.
4. Go over your page and see where you can work in the words that you
didn’t use. Then for words that you did use, look for places you might
use them again without screwing up the flow of the writing.
After you’ve done these things, toss the list in the trash and reread your
page. If it’s still good, go with it. If it doesn’t read well, you may have to sacrifice some of the terms to make the text more reader-friendly.

Avoiding keyword trickery
Lots of the get-rich-quick sites advise you to raise your ratings with the
search engines by stacking the deck. Typically, this involves using the same
phrase over and over again in your meta tags, like this:
<META name=”keywords” content=”computer books, computer
books, computer books, computer books, computer
books, computer books, computer books”>
Another common trick is to put content like that into the text of the page
itself. Often, Webmasters hide this bogus text from their human readers by
setting its color to the same as the page’s background color or by making the
text so small that it’s barely visible — or both.

Avoiding traps
The traps, in this case, are some of the perfectly
normal Web site design approaches. If you use
frames or image maps, you’re asking for trouble
with the search engines. Why? Because many
of the search engines don’t navigate frames
properly, and none of them can read the text
in an image map. The same problem crops up
when people use images containing text as a
part of the image itself — your human visitors

can read it, but a search engine’s robot won’t
even know it exists.
Does that mean you can’t do things like putting
text-filled images in a table for layout purposes?
No — and you don’t have to give up on frames
or image maps, either. But you do have to provide a plain old text-link-alternative approach to
these fancier methods. Lots of Web designers
do so anyway to accommodate old or off-brand
Web browsers.

Chapter 13: Attracting an Audience: Publicizing Your Site
This common trick is not the same thing as legitimately using the same terms
and phrases several times in different places within the real context of your
Web page. If you run a site that deals with airports, for example, the word
runway may show up hundreds of times on one page, and anyone searching
for that term will rightly find your page.
So why not use the trick method? Well, for starters, it doesn’t work. Playing
these kinds of games with keywords is a fast way to get dropped from the
major search engines altogether. The people who run search engines aren’t
stupid, and they’re fully aware of this type of stunt. They don’t care for sites
that try to stack the deck, because they’re in the business of providing good
results, and tricks like these skew the results. You don’t want to make enemies of the search-engine folks; it’s much better to keep on their good side.
Even if you do manage to find a workable trick that artificially boosts your
ranking, you’re not doing yourself any favors. What if you end up number one
on every search, but your actual content isn’t what you said it was (it’s all
just a clever use of keywords)? Do you think that the people who drop in to
check out your site will be coming back? After they find out that you’re not
delivering what you promised, they’ll be off to other destinations before you
can blink, and they won’t pay any attention to your listing after that, even if it
does turn up on top in their next search.
Some of the Web sites that come up on the first page of search results turn out
to be dead links. If those sites had paid more attention to site-design fundamentals than to search-engine rankings, they might still be around.

Analyzing keywords that
other sites are using
Taking a look at what other people are doing with keywords can be instructive. You can find out just what people are searching for plenty of ways; if
some of those terms fit in with what you’re doing, you may want to work
them in. Here are some ways to analyze keywords:
✓ Keyword Analysis Tool: One of the best sites you can visit is Keyword
Analysis Tool, shown in Figure 13-1. It runs a check on sites you specify

219

220 Part IV: Making Money
to see what keywords they’re using. You can download it for free from
http://www.webmaster-toolkit.com/keyword-analysis-tool.
shtml. Try it. You’ll like it.
✓ Keyword Extractor: Check out Keyword Extractor, a useful freebie from
AnalogX (see Figure 13-2). You can find it at http://www.analogx.
com/contents/download/Network/keyex/Freeware.htm.
Keyword Extractor lets you analyze Web pages just like search engines
do. It indexes all the words on the page and assigns weights to them
depending on their frequency of use and position on the page. One of
the best ways to use this program is to perform a search at one of the
major search sites, follow the links to the top-ranked pages, and run
Keyword Extractor on each of those pages. Study the results to see how
those pages earned their ranks.

Don’t just toss in popular search terms in an attempt to generate bogus hits.
Adding sex and MP3 to a site that’s about walrus migration patterns won’t
bring you the kind of visitors you’re looking for.

Keyword advertising
Analysis of your site’s keywords is also important in the multifaceted world
of keyword advertising, such as the use of Google AdSense to place targeted
ads on Web sites and in search results. The flip side of this process is Google
AdWords (http://adwords.google.com), which is where the advertisements come from.
The nice thing about Google AdSense is that it pays you to use it. With
programs such as Google AdWords or Yahoo! Search Marketing (http://
searchmarketing.yahoo.com), however, you’ll be getting a bill rather
than a check. If you’ve always thought of Google, Yahoo!, and such Web staples as free, think again — this is where they make their money. Just like TV
or radio, it’s the advertisers who pay for it all. Advertisers do this by buying
space on a search engine’s results page (see Figure 13-3). Which results page,
though, and where? That depends upon the keyword the user entered and
several other factors. All other things being equal, the advertiser who pays
the most gets the top slot. The ad might also be limited to display in certain
geographical regions.

221

222 Part IV: Making Money
If you’re still with me, don’t worry — the bill can fit within almost any type
of budget. Perhaps the most important limitation you can specify is the
most money you’re willing to spend in a month. Although you can officially
get started with pocket change (at this writing, Google AdWords has a mere
$5 registration fee), it’s important to manage your advertising budget carefully. Fortunately, prompt feedback is a normal feature of these advertising
programs. If you’d like to start advertising with Google AdWords, be sure to

Submitting to the Search Sites
You can just sit around and wait for a spider or robot to trip over your site.
Sooner or later, that’ll probably happen all by itself — the search engines are
always hungry for more sites to add. But being proactive and making certain
that your site is listed is a lot smarter. You can submit your site on your own,
or you can use services that do it for you.

Chapter 13: Attracting an Audience: Publicizing Your Site

Doing it yourself
Why bother doing it yourself when you can pay someone else to do it for
you? Well, there’s the obvious advantage of saving money. If you’re on a
shoestring budget, that can matter. If not, you’re likely going to say something like this: “It’s more cost-effective for me to pay someone to get my site
submitted to search engines than for me to take time away from actually running the business.” There’s something to be said for that reasoning too.
But there’s nothing like making sure the job gets done right. And it’s a wise
Webmaster who gets thoroughly familiar with the many variations on how
the search engines want Web page URLs to be submitted. I strongly recommend that you try submitting to at least a few of them yourself. Table 13-2
gives the URLs of the submission pages for several major search sites.

Some search engines charge for adding your site to their listings, and more
may do so. Yahoo! offers unpaid listings only for noncommercial sites. Make
sure that you find out whether it’s free before you submit.
Most search engines accept submissions in pretty much the same way, and
the process is pretty simple. With Google, for example, you simply go to
www.google.com/addurl.html (see Figure 13-4), enter your URL, and
click the Add URL button.
Yahoo! works the same way. Just go to https://siteexplorer.search.
yahoo.com/submit/ and enter the URL of your home page, then click the
Submit URL button.

Using submission services
You get what you pay for, you know? When it comes to Web site submission services, that saying really hits home. Very few of the free services
submit your URL to anywhere near as many search sites as the paid ones do.
Although the paid services submit your info to many more search engines,
you don’t get much payback from listing in all the obscure ones.
Many Web site submission services fall into a gray area, offering limited free
services but charging more for anything extra. The paid services may or may
not be worthwhile, depending on how well they know their stuff. If you’re
going to part with your hard-earned bucks, you have the right to ask them a
few questions first. Make sure that the people you’re dealing with understand
the differences among the search engines. If they can’t tell you (for example)
which ones accept HTML coding in their listings or how long a description is
acceptable at a particular search site, you may not be getting much bang for
your buck. You may be better off doing it yourself.
ProBoost (www.proboost.com), shown in Figure 13-5, is one classy example
of folks who know what search engines are all about. With ProBoost, you
don’t just fill out a form. You can actually work with real, live people who are
committed to your success. ProBoost has free telephone support and a chat
room, too.

Keeping out of the search sites
Not everybody wants all their pages indexed and offered to the general
public at a search site; you may, for instance, want to share things with
family or a small circle of friends, but not the entire world. There are two
methods you can use to keep a search engine’s robot from indexing your site.
One may require the assistance of your network administrator or Internet
service provider. The other you can do yourself.

Getting outside assistance
For a long time, the only way to lock a search engine out was to use a file called
robots.txt. This file, located in the top-level domain directory (the same one
your home page goes into), lists all banned search bots as well as directories
that can’t be searched. The reason you may need some professional help here
is that unless you run your own dedicated server, you may not have access to
the top-level domain directory. Putting robots.txt anywhere else doesn’t do
you any good. If your Web site is housed on your ISP’s server or on a virtual
server, it’s really in a subdirectory of a dedicated Web server. What you need
to do, in this case, is to let the people who run your HTTP server know which
directories you don’t want searched. They’ll take care of the rest — which consists of simply listing those directories in a text file.

225

226 Part IV: Making Money
The following example shows how to block all search bots from searching
two sample directories:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /~mine/private/
Disallow: /~mine/personal/
Someone who wants to pry into your site can get a good start by looking at the
contents of your robots.txt file. After all, it contains a list of all the directories and files you don’t want the world to see. If you have anything confidential in those areas, robots.txt is a road map pointing straight to it.

Doing it yourself
If you want to grab control yourself, or if you just want to avoid using
robots.txt, you can turn to that good old friend, the META tag. Remember
that I said that tag is versatile. Well, this is another useful application for it.
By assigning the name attribute a value of robots and adding one or more
variables to the content attribute, you can specify your desires about the
page it’s in.
By default, a search robot will not only index your page (adding the words
in it to the search site’s database), but also follow all the links on the page. If
you want to disallow both of these behaviors, add the following HTML code
in the HEAD element of your file:
<META name=”robots” content=”noindex,nofollow”>
You can accomplish the same thing by using a value of none:
<META name=”robots” content=”none”>
Technically, you could do the opposite — that is, allow both options — by
using a value of all, but there’s no point in doing that. If you want both
options working, just don’t do anything.
To allow the indexing, but keep robots from following your links, use this line
of code:
<META name=”robots” content=”nofollow”>
Remember that the robot’s indexing and following of links are default behaviors, so you don’t need to specify either one if you’re allowing it. Thus, the
preceding code doesn’t mention indexing at all. You could, if you want to be
pedantic about it, say the same thing like this:
<META name=”robots” content=”index,nofollow”>

Chapter 13: Attracting an Audience: Publicizing Your Site
The situation would have to be unusual, but you may wish for a robot to
follow the links in a particular directory without adding the pages in it to a
search engine. To allow a robot to follow your links, but deny it from indexing, use this code:
<META name=”robots” content=”noindex”>

Checking Your Search Site Position
You need to follow up on your submissions to make sure you’re listed (different search sites react on different timetables) as well as to find out where
you land in the rankings when your keywords are used in a search.
Obviously, the fastest way to find out both of these things is to log on to the
search engines you’ve submitted to and check. First, enter the name of your
site and see if it comes up. If it doesn’t come up, and more time has elapsed
than the search engine is supposed to take, you may want to resubmit your
site.
This is also a great way to find out which other Web sites have links to yours,
because any page with your site’s name on it will show up in the search
results. (See the next section “Investigating Reciprocal Linking.”)
If your site does come up, you’ll want to enter the keywords from your site
as search terms. This quickly shows you where you fall in the rankings.
Assuming that some other sites show up on top of your own, it’s worthwhile
to take a look at their source code to see what keywords they use. Also, don’t
forget to look over their pages carefully. This is one of those rare instances
where your competitors’ techniques are literally an open book.

Investigating Reciprocal Linking
Reciprocal linking is the Web’s equivalent of “You scratch my back, and I’ll
scratch yours.” The way it works looks like this: You put in a link on your
page to another Web site, and the other Web site returns the favor by putting
in a link to yours. Even directly competing sites can benefit from linking to
one another, just as two restaurants can happily exist side by side.

227

228 Part IV: Making Money
Finding sites to link to
So whom do you want to link with? Well, the simple answer is “anybody and
everybody.” The smart answer, though, is “the best and most popular sites in
my category.” What’s best is a matter of opinion, but it’s pretty easy to find
the most popular ones, and you can use this technique to piggyback on their
success.
What you need to do is to spend some time working the search engines.
Here’s the drill:
1. Enter the keywords you think people would use to find your site.
2. Follow the links in the results to the other sites that are similar to
your own.
All search engines will return at least some poor responses, so don’t
automatically assume that all the results would be good sources of
reciprocal links for your Web site. Use your own judgment.
3. Look for an e-mail link to the site’s owner.
Typically, you can find this type of link at the bottom of the page, but it
may be anywhere.
4. Click the e-mail link and send the site’s Webmaster a message politely
suggesting that you both link up.
It may be helpful to put in a link to the other site first. That way you can say
something like, “I’ve linked to your site and would appreciate a return link
from yours.” This takes the discussion out of the realm of the hypothetical
and puts the other site’s Webmaster under an obligation to respond in kind.
There are no guarantees, but most people do reciprocate.
Sometimes you can’t find any contact info on a Web site, no matter how hard
you look. If that’s the case and you really want to set up a reciprocal link with
that site, you can run a search on the site’s domain name by using a WhoIs
service. WhoIs identifies the administrative, billing, and technical contacts
for a domain. The best known one is at Network Solutions (www.network
solutions.com/whois/index.jsp). Or you can run a search from
your own system with software such as WhoIs ULTRA from AnalogX (www.
analogx.com/contents/download/network/whois.htm).
Another worthwhile program you may want to check out is Link Trader. You
use Link Trader to create a database of all the people you’ve set up reciprocal links with, and it checks those sites to verify that the link back to you still
exists. Keep the database up to date and run the program on a regular basis,
and you can quickly spot any sites that drop your link. Then you can e-mail

Chapter 13: Attracting an Audience: Publicizing Your Site
the Webmasters and ask them to put the link back in. You can download Link
Trader Pro at www.homebizfactory.com/Link_Trader_Pro.html.
Many search engines (Google, for example) consider the number of other sites
with links to yours when determining how high you rank. This means that of
two sites, with everything else being equal, the one with more links leading to
it from other sites shows up before the other one in search results. Reciprocal
linking is a powerful tool that you can use to legitimately boost your own site’s
rankings.

Joining Web rings
Web rings are a kind of super-size reciprocal link arrangement. Instead of
making a reciprocal link between two sites, you make it with an entire group
of similar sites at one time. You can find Web rings on just about any topic
you can think of, and many such rings are listed at http://dir.webring.
com/rw or www.ringsurf.com. (See Figure 13-6.) You can also start your
own Web ring if you want.

Figure 13-6:
RingSurf is a
good source
for Web
rings.

229

230 Part IV: Making Money
The weakness of Web rings is that they link in a ring. In other words, each
one links to the previous one in the list and the next one in the list. If any site
drops out of the ring, that messes up the whole thing, just as if you broke a
link in a chain.

Joining a banner exchange
In a banner exchange, each member creates a banner ad and submits it to
a central site. That site, the exchange itself, automates the process of displaying all the members’ ads on all the other members’ Web sites. A banner
exchange sounds like a great idea, but in practice, few banner exchanges
survive for very long. If you’re considering joining one, make sure that you
ask how long it’s been in operation. Also make it a point to contact current
members and see how satisfied they are with the exchange.
That said, joining a banner exchange is an easy task. You fill out a simple
application form on the exchange’s Web site; then you send the exchange
your banner and place some HTML code on your site. That’s all there is to
it — the exchange handles everything else. Several reputable banner
exchanges are listed in Table 13-3.

Designing for Internet Commerce
In This Chapter
▶ Finding your niche
▶ Delivering the goods

▶ Adding a search function
▶ Adding a FAQ

M

ore pure bull hockey is floating around about Internet commerce than
about practically any other topic in the world. If you haven’t found
thousands of e-commerce Web sites promising you the moon — and a moon
made of gold and platinum at that — you aren’t looking.
According to these self-proclaimed gurus of e-commerce, all you need to do
is put up a Web page — not even a site, just a page — and the money comes
rolling in. You can vacation in Acapulco this weekend and sun yourself on the
Riviera by Monday. The secret to this success? Well, of course, they can’t just
tell you what it is. That kind of information is worth some real money, you
know.
This “get-rich-quick-over-the-Internet” scheme reminds me of an ad that used
to run in the backs of cheap magazines many, many years ago. For 25¢, the
ad promised, you could discover how to make a fortune fast. After you sent
in your quarter, you got back a pamphlet that, boiled down to its basics, told
you to put an ad in a magazine asking people to send you a quarter. Today’s
get-rich-quick schemes are no more solid than that one, even if they’re
draped in the latest finery of high technology.
So is there any truth at all to the glowing promise of Internet commerce? Yes,
there is. The Internet represents the greatest market that’s ever existed, and
the opportunity is very real. You can make a fortune in e-commerce, just as
you can make a fortune in any other kind of commerce. But success takes
a combination of brains, toughness, marketing savvy, luck, and — most of
all — determination to succeed. In this chapter, I show you how to become a
real Internet marketer.

232 Part IV: Making Money
Learning the Real Secret
to Internet Success
Are you ready for the real secret of success in any business? Here it is:
Put the right product or service in front of the right audience at the
right time for the right price.
There ya go. That’s all you need to do to succeed. Well, okay, implementing
this advice isn’t always easy. And when it comes to e-commerce, there are
some special considerations.

Developing the right attitude
If you go into Internet commerce figuring that you don’t need to do any real
work — that it’s just something that you can dabble in between football
games or pay attention to if you happen to feel like it — then you’re better off
going fishing. At least that way you may end up with food on your table.
To win in any kind of business, you need a different attitude from what you
need just to hold down a job. Let’s face it: The whole point of most jobs is
merely to keep a paycheck coming in. Most people work in jobs they don’t
care all that much about — or even in jobs they hate. They stick with their
jobs solely because they have bills to pay. (Honestly, would you show up for
work if you won the lottery? No? Neither would most people.)
If you run your own business, though, work is different. If you’re sick and
tired of rush hour, wearing suits and ties or high heels, and having bosses
stand over your shoulder demanding that you work harder than they do, the
Internet may be your ticket to financial independence. But you must pay a
certain price. To run your own business, you must work harder than you ever
have before. And you need to take a good, hard look at who you really are.
Notice that I’m not saying “what you really want” but “who you really are.”
There’s a good reason for that. If you’re going to win in business, you win, not
because you’re doing some particular thing, but because you’re being yourself.
In my own case, if I won the lottery, I’d take a few days off to meet with my
attorneys and accountants and get everything in order, but I’d go back to
work as soon as possible. I can’t help it because I’m a book person. Winning
enough money to afford even more books can’t change that fact.

Chapter 14: Designing for Internet Commerce
What do you love most in the world? Whatever is your true passion is also
your natural business. If you do anything else with your life, you can’t give
it the same kind of energy. That’s plain old human nature. Who can give 100
percent all the time if they don’t care about the outcome? If you’re stuck
in a job at a desk in a cubicle and the company you work for experiences a
crisis, what you do usually doesn’t matter. The situation isn’t your doing, and
you’re not in charge anyway. Even if you do manage, by superhuman effort,
to overcome the situation and save the day, you know you probably won’t
even get a raise out of it. After all, you’re just doing your duty.
If you want to make a break from the traditional working world, you must
make a clean break from the employee attitude, too. An Internet business is
different — it’s yours. It’s a part of you, and if you listen to your inner voice,
it’s a natural extension of yourself. It’s not what you do — it’s who you are.

Focusing on your business
Many people believe that you can sell anything on the Internet. After all,
zillions of people are on it, so anything you create is sure to appeal to
someone. Well, that belief is more or less true, but it doesn’t mean you can
make money automatically from your creation.
If you’re serious about making money, you must remember the key factor in
a Web site’s appeal: focus, focus, focus. If you run your site as a hobby or a
public service, you can afford to drift a bit, but if you depend on it for your
living, you must stay on target. Any drifting off the mark costs you money.
What I’m talking about here is specialization. When it comes to general
merchandise, the Internet is pretty much already lost to you. Why? Because
it’s got JCPenney and Kmart and Wal-Mart (see Figure 14-1) and all those
other well-established companies with very deep pockets. You’re not going
to put those companies out of business in a physical shopping mall, and
you’re not going to take them out on the Internet either. They already enjoy
the kind of name recognition that takes a long time to build. And they can
spend more money on one ad than the average online business has in its
annual budget.
Even if you do have the kind of bucks that it takes to go up against the big
outfits, I advise you to put your money into specialized stores. The future of
e-commerce lies in smaller companies that can focus all their energies on a
relatively small market. Here’s where the size of the Internet really comes
into play for you — a relatively small market on the Internet is much larger
than it would be even in a large city.

233

234 Part IV: Making Money

Figure 14-1:
The major

Reaching customers all over the globe is the Internet’s greatest strength. Like
the telephone and air travel before it, the Net is making the world — especially
the world of commerce — much smaller than it was even ten years ago. By
targeting a particular submarket, you can tightly focus your business efforts and
still reach more people than you ever could reach by running a local business.
And a functional Web site is much cheaper than even a small physical store.
You can indeed start successful businesses on a shoestring if you use the Net.
Even if you do need some kind of physical facilities for your operation, such
as storage space for your products, you don’t need to concern yourself
with the appearance and attractiveness of those facilities. For most online
businesses, a small warehouse space does just as well as a fancy, glitzy store
in a major shopping mall. In many cases, you can start with a spare room in
your house. If you end up needing more room to handle all the merchandise
that people are ordering . . . well, we should all have such problems, right?

Getting supplies flowing
Okay, so now you know what your online business is all about. If you choose
wisely, you probably already know plenty about the field. You know all the major
suppliers, your competition, and all sorts of little tidbits that outsiders know
nothing about. You know what other companies in the industry have tried, what
worked and what didn’t, and how your potential customers feel about it all.

Chapter 14: Designing for Internet Commerce
Depending on your field, either you create your product or you line up some
good, low-cost suppliers. If you create your own product or market your own
service, you’re already there. If you rely on outsiders, though, you must do
some research. Even if you already have a supplier in mind, you’ll probably be
able to find a better deal (or get more or better services) if you ask around.

Identifying potential suppliers
Track down everyone who makes what you want to sell. Use search engines to
find their Web sites and then print out some of those companies’ Web pages.
Make folders for each company (the manila kind, not the hard-drive kind) and
arrange the hard copies neatly so you can refer to them at a moment’s notice.
If a site you’re researching offers a Contacts link, follow it to see whether its
information is useful to you. Different companies provide different amounts of
contact data. Some companies have confusing and relatively worthless listings
or nothing significant at all. Others provide fully detailed breakdowns of their
operations by department and by significant personnel, including everything
from phone numbers, to e-mail and snail-mail addresses, to descriptions of
people’s job functions. You’re looking for the director of sales and marketing.
In the unlikely event that one isn’t listed, go for the shipping manager.
The Contacts link may say something different, such as About Our Company
or Regional Offices. Be creative and explore the site exhaustively when you’re
looking for contact info.
If you can’t find the information you’re looking for on the company’s Web
site, you can turn to one of the many business-phone-number databases on
the Web. I list some for you in Table 14-1.

AT&T listings.

235

236 Part IV: Making Money
After you get a phone number and/or e-mail address, check with the supplier
to find out whether it uses drop-shipping. (Drop-shipping is an arrangement
in which you gather the orders and submit them to the supplier; the supplier
then sends the merchandise directly to the customer and puts your return
address on it. You, of course, must pay the supplier for the merchandise, but
you pay a wholesale rate and keep the rest for your profit.)
If the supplier doesn’t drop-ship, find out the minimum order you can place —
and what kind of discount (if any) you get for different sizes of orders. In
either case, make sure that you find out how long the company normally
takes to fulfill your orders. You need to know this information so you can
quote an expected delivery time to your customers. (Now you know why so
many order forms say something like “Allow 4 to 6 weeks for delivery.”)

Choosing a shipping company
If you get stuck with delivering the product to your customers yourself, you
need to establish a business account with at least one shipping company.
Most companies traditionally use UPS for shipping merchandise, although
offering several alternatives to your customers doesn’t hurt. You can also
use the U.S. Postal Service, and FedEx is making a serious effort to compete
with UPS these days on its own turf. Table 14-2 lists the URLs for some of the
major shipping companies’ Web sites.

Chapter 14: Designing for Internet Commerce

Designing for E-Commerce
You may understand Web site design in general, but designing an online
store requires some special considerations. Face the fact — if you’re building
a shopping mall in the real world, do you want an architect who specializes in
houses or an architect who’s built stores all his life?
Yes, your Web site must display a pretty face. Yes, it must perform all the
functions you need to show your wares and process orders. But the key point
to Web design is this one rule:
It must be simple to use.
If customers face any kind of hitch in the process, you’re going to lose money.
That’s guaranteed — 100 percent. As you plan the site design for an e-commerce
store, you must approach it from the buyer’s viewpoint and concentrate
on making the store easy to navigate and the buying process painless.
Regardless of what you sell, here are some ways to satisfy your potential
buyers’ needs:
✓ Include a picture of the product. If you sell some type of merchandise,
make sure that you include at least one picture.
Use thumbnail images instead of full-sized ones so that the basic product
page doesn’t take too long to load. (Customers may lose interest if they
must wait too long for the site to load.)
✓ Give detailed information, if appropriate. How much information you
give depends on what you’re selling. With many products, you can easily
fit all the necessary information about the product into the product’s
description. However, providing additional information gives you an
opportunity to sing the product’s praises at length, even if the extra info
isn’t totally necessary.
✓ Clearly state the cost. Put the price right out in the open where everyone
can see it. You’d be surprised how often you can follow link after link on
e-commerce sites without ever finding the price clearly stated.
✓ Make it easy for customers to buy the product. If you’re using shoppingcart software for multiple products, make sure that it’s easy to use and
doesn’t require a bunch of back-and-forth steps to work. If you sell a single
product or service, make sure that your site can quickly accommodate the
customer’s decision to buy. Here are a few ways to do that:

237

238 Part IV: Making Money
• Put a Buy This Now link at the top of the page — and put one at the
bottom, too.
• Don’t ask a bunch of extra questions on the order form. Stick with
the basics, such as name, address, payment method, and shipping
options.
• If you want to add a survey, add it after the entire sales process is
complete, not as an impediment to the ongoing sale.

Adding a Search Function
Unless your site consists of just a single Web page, you need a search engine
for it. Sites that don’t offer search functions are at a real disadvantage
compared with those that do have them. Put yourself in a visitor’s shoes
and ask, “Do I want to spend hours browsing this site in the hope that I may
stumble across the information I want? Or do I want to spend a few seconds
running a search to get the information I need right away?”
All the search options described in the following sections have their own
strengths and weaknesses. Similar programs and services offer varying
features. The importance of each feature is a matter for you to decide. I
recommend checking out all of them. Because none of them requires much
effort to install and use, you may as well road-test every one to see which you
like best.

Using Google Site Search
Google Site Search is one of the best of the zillions of valuable tools that
Google provides to the Web. You just slap a search box into your Web pages
and bam! Your users can search every page in your site — or the whole Web,
if you want — using the powerful Google search engine.
Before you can use it, though, you have to get a Google account. No worries —
this is a no-obligation situation; you’re just getting one more username.
There are lots of Google tools that require this account first, so even if you
don’t end up using Google Site Search, you’ll probably still want to get the
account.

Chapter 14: Designing for Internet Commerce
Getting the account
To sign up for your Google account, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount in your Web
browser. (See Figure 14-2.)
2. Enter your e-mail address.
3. Enter your desired password twice (once in each password text box).
4. Scroll down and select your location. (See Figure 14-3.)
5. Under Word Verification, type the characters that are shown above
the text box.
This is a measure designed to defeat automated account piracy. Humans
can read the graphics characters; computers can’t.
6. Click the button that says, I Accept. Create My Account.
Google will e-mail you a confirmation at the address you entered back in
Step 2.
7. Click the link in that message to complete the creation of your
account.

Getting a free search engine with FreeFind
After you take a look at the capabilities of FreeFind’s search engine (www.
freefind.com), you may not bother to look at anything else (except that
I describe another one that’s worth a peek, too). It’s a beautifully designed,
full-featured, honey of a search feature that you can add to your site in just
a few minutes. It’s customizable, creates a site map for you, keeps an upto-date What’s New list that shows visitors what you’ve added lately, gives
you extensive reports on what people are looking for, and does pretty near
everything else you can ask for, except fry your eggs for breakfast. The cost?
Nothing.
After you finish drooling over the search engine, you may ask, “What’s the
catch?” Advertising supports it — which means that an ad banner appears at
the top of the search page on your site. If your site also has its own advertisers,
you can’t show any of your ads in competition with FreeFind’s ads on that
page.
On most sites, an advertising banner is a pretty small point to consider. Even
if you have your own sponsors, you can still place their ads on every page on
your site that doesn’t have FreeFind, and FreeFind helps your visitors get to
all those other pages more easily. FreeFind imposes a site limit of about 2,000
Web pages (32MB), but a polite e-mail message to the FreeFind folks generally
gets them to raise the limit.

Chapter 14: Designing for Internet Commerce
You do face one other restriction with FreeFind: FreeFind doesn’t allow
anyone to use its search engine on adults-only sites, because its advertisers
don’t want to appear on such sites.
Still with me? Okay, FreeFind’s search engine runs on its servers, not on
yours, so tons of people can use it simultaneously without tying up all your
server resources.
You can set up FreeFind to search just your site, just the World Wide Web
outside your site, or both your site and the Web in the same search. You can
modify the search form, and FreeFind makes the job extremely easy for you
by providing online wizards that help you make custom choices, such as
designating link colors (either by name or hexadecimal value).

Joining FreeFind
To sign up for FreeFind, all you need to do is to fill out a simple form, as the
following steps describe:
1. Go to FreeFind’s home page (www.freefind.com) and enter your
Web site address and your e-mail address in the appropriate text
boxes. (See Figure 14-9.)
FreeFind keeps your e-mail address confidential, so your address won’t
be sold to anyone.
2. Click the Instant Sign-Up button.
FreeFind sends you an e-mail confirmation message right away. The
message contains your password, site ID, and all the links you need to
use its service.
3. Click the link in the e-mail confirmation message to go to the FreeFind
Control Center (www.freefind.com/control.html).
4. In the form on that page, enter your Web site address, e-mail address,
and the password from the e-mail confirmation message; then click
the Login button.
The Select Account Type page appears.
5. Click the Select link next to Free Account.
Of course, if you’re the adventurous type who wants to skip the “try
before you buy” approach, you can always click one of the paid service
links instead.
You only have to complete this step the first time you sign in to
FreeFind.
6. On the main Control Center page, click the Build Index tab (shown in
Figure 14-10).

7. Click the Index Now link.
8. In the dialog box that appears, click the Finish button to have
FreeFind index your site.
FreeFind starts indexing your site and e-mails you when it’s finished. At the
same time it does the indexing, FreeFind also creates a site map and a What’s
New page for your Web site.

Adding the search engine
FreeFind gives you the HTML code for a basic search panel you can add to
your pages. All you need to do is copy and paste the version you want (either
from the e-mail message or the attachment) onto the Web page on which you
want to use it, and then upload the page to your site, and your search engine
will be fully functional.
You can’t use the search engine until FreeFind finishes indexing your site. If
you try to use it before FreeFind is finished indexing, you receive an e-mail
message saying that the spider’s indexing of your site isn’t complete, and you
get a Web page reminding you to wait.
Here’s how to go to the goodies page and get your free code (if you’re already
in the FreeFind Control Center from the previous steps, you can skip straight
to Step 3 here):
1. Go to the FreeFind Control Center at www.freefind.com/
control.html.
2. Enter your Web site address, e-mail address, and password, and then
click the Login button.
3. On the main Control Center page, click the HTML tab (shown in
Figure 14-11).
4. Scroll down the screen and view the different types of search panels
that are available.
You can also click the links at the top of the page to jump to particular
kinds of panels, such as ones that search your site only, as opposed to
those that search the Web and your site.
5. When you find a search panel you want, click inside the text area
underneath it, which contains the HTML code, and select the code.
6. Copy the code and paste it into your own Web page code.
If you want to customize and pretty up the search page, go to the Control
Center page and click the Customize tab. You can specify background colors
and images, the type of logo that appears, the positioning of the search results,
and many other options. The choices that you make there also affect your site
map so that both the search page and the site map share the same look.

Dropping in Perl CGI scripts
such as Simple Search
If you’re a go-it-alone type who doesn’t want to rely on outside servers to
process your site searches, you can drop in a Perl CGI script instead. (See
Chapter 8 for more on scripts.) It requires a bit more technical skill than
some tasks, or a little bit of help from your ISP or network administrator, but
it’s definitely doable, even if you don’t know anything about CGI. One of the
best and easiest CGI scripts to use is Simple Search. Written by Matt Wright,
one of CGI’s greats, Simple Search has been a venerable mainstay of many
Web sites. Figure 14-12 shows Simple Search on a Web page.
You can download Simple Search from Matt’s Script Archive at world
widemart.com/scripts/search.shtml. To add Simple Search to your
site, you first need to uncompress (unzip) the main file for the program
(simple.zip, simple.tar, or whatever) and then make a few alterations in
the enclosed sample files.

Chapter 14: Designing for Internet Commerce
You need to change a few settings in the script to make it work on your site.
Make sure that you follow the exact format of what appears in these settings
as you replace the sample values in the script with the information for your
site, or the script won’t work. This mostly means you must leave all quotation
marks and semicolons in place just as they appear in the following examples.
Don’t replace single quotes with double quotes or vice versa. Keeping a hard
copy of the file handy while working on it may help you to remember what to
do — and what not to do.

Figure 14-12:
Simple
Search adds
keywordsearching
capabilities
to your site.

To prepare the Simple Search’s Perl script for use, follow these steps:
1. Go to http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/search.shtml and
open the file search.pl in a text editor.
2. Scroll down until you reach the section with the heading # Define
Variables.
3. Replace the $basedir value with the base directory path of your own
site.
For example, in the following script line, the sample value for this
variable is /mnt/web/guide/worldwidemart/scripts/. Remember
to replace only the value itself, not the variable ($basedir) or any
punctuation marks.
$basedir = ‘/mnt/web/guide/worldwidemart/scripts/’;
The base directory path is the path on your Web server, not your Web
site’s URL, which you add in the following step. If you don’t know this
value, ask your ISP or network administrator. Make sure that you include
the trailing slash at the end (/).

249

250 Part IV: Making Money
4. Replace the $baseurl value with the base URL of your site.
The value you need to supply for the $baseurl variable is the URL
of the directory where your site’s main page resides. The base URL
for Dummies.com, for example, is http://www.dummies.com/. And
using both http:// and the trailing slash is important here, too, even if
you’re not accustomed to using both in Web addresses. In the following
line from the script, the value you need to replace is http://world
widemart.com/scripts/:
$baseurl = ‘http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/’;
5. Replace the sample values for the @files variable with the paths and
files that you want Simple Search to process as part of its search.
In the following line from the script, the values you need to replace are
*.shtml, demos/links/*.html, and demos/guest/*.html:
@files = (‘*.shtml’,’demos/links/*.html’,
’demos/guest/*.html’);
This is one of the easiest places to create a typographical error that
keeps the script from working because the @files variable can have
more than one value. Each value is surrounded by single quotation
marks, as usual, but it’s also separated from the other values by a
comma. If you use more than one value here, pay careful attention to the
sample code’s syntax.
If you want to search only HTML files in the main directory, for example,
enter the value that the following example shows:
@files = (‘*.html’);
To search both HTML and SHTML files in the main directory, use the
following example instead:
@files = (‘*.html’,’*.shtml’);
To search for HTML and SHTML files in a subdirectory called fauna as
well, use the following example:
@files = (‘*.html’,’*.shtml’,’*/fauna.*html’,
’/fauna/*.shtml’);
6. Replace the value of the $title variable with the name of your site.
In the following line from the script, the sample value you need to
replace is Matt’s Script Archive.
$title = “Matt’s Script Archive”;
This value appears along with the search results, and the next step
makes the text into a text link.

Chapter 14: Designing for Internet Commerce
7. Replace the value of the $titleurl variable with the Web address
of your main page. In the following line from the script, the value you
need to replace is http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/.
$title_url = ‘http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/’;
This value is usually the same as the $baseurl value (see Step 4),
although you may want to add the page’s filename as well. For example,
if your $baseurl value is http://www.mysite.com/ and your main
page is index.html, you can use either http://www.mysite.com/ or
http://www.mysite.com/index.html as the value for $titleurl.
8. Replace the $searchurl value with the Web address of your search
page. In the following line from the script, the part you need to
replace is http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/demos/search/
search.html.
$search_url = ‘http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/demos/
search/search.html’;
9. Save the file.
To prepare the HTML search page for use, follow these steps:
1. Open the file search.html in a text editor.
2. Change the action attribute of the FORM element to the URL where
you’re locating the Perl script on your Web server.
In the following line from the search.html file, the value you need to
replace is http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/cgi-bin/demos/
search.cgi.
<form method=POST action=”http://worldwidemart.com/
scripts/cgi-bin/demos/search.cgi”>
3. Save the file.
Now upload both files to your server. Make sure that you send search.pl
in ASCII form and that you put it in your cgi-bin directory. Send search.
html in ASCII form and put it in your Web page directory.
You have two options when uploading files. Your FTP program will send a file
as either ASCII or binary. ASCII treats the file as text, binary is used for graphics,
and so on.
Okay, remember I told you this one took a bit more tech savvy than most?
This is where that hint comes into play. You need to set permissions for the
files so they’ll work on your Web server. If you don’t know what that means,
don’t worry about it. Just ask your ISP or network administrator to do it
for you. Tell them you need to “chmod search.pl to 755 and to chmod
search.html to 744.” They’ll know what you mean, and they can take care
of it in about ten seconds.

251

252 Part IV: Making Money
There are various opinions on how to pronounce “chmod.” Most folks say
“chuh-mod,” but others say “shmod” or “see-aich-mod.”

Adding a FAQ
FAQ is Internet-ese for “Frequently Asked Questions.” Just like it sounds, this
is a list of the questions that most users ask most often. Including one can
save you lots of time when it comes to providing tech support to your
visitors. That’s why you usually see a link at the top of any support page
asking users to view the FAQ before contacting the site’s support team.
You can try to invent a FAQ before you ever go live with your Web site, but
you’re probably going to have to wait a while until users actually do ask
enough questions before the content of your FAQ actually justifies the name.
If you do decide to go with the first option, the best technique is to ask
friends and members of your family to surf your nascent site and write down
anything that they find problematic. You can then take all their comments
and work up a set of responses to create your preliminary FAQ so that you
don’t have to go live with nothing.

Checking Out Online
Payment Methods
In This Chapter
▶ Using PayPal and Google Checkout
▶ Becoming a credit card merchant
▶ Avoiding pitfalls
▶ Converting currencies

I

f you’re operating a regular store, taking in money from customers is a
pretty easy matter. Cash, checks, credit cards, debit cards — you name it,
and some well-established process is in place to handle it. From night-deposit
drops to armored car pickups, the bricks-and-mortar merchant is already
well covered when it comes to getting paid.
You won’t find any cash registers online, though, so you need to look at
other options. The major approach is to take credit cards. You can, however,
arrange to be paid in other ways, such as accepting checks by phone or using
digital money. So far, however, none of the other ways can really compete
with the power of plastic.

Checking Out Online Payment Methods
Credit cards are king. If you do nothing but take MasterCard and VISA, you’re
pretty thoroughly covered. Nearly everyone who can afford a computer has
one or both of them. Toss in American Express for the high-end customer
and the business client, and you’re all set. But some alternatives are out
there, and you may want to add some or all of them to your setup.

254 Part IV: Making Money
PayPal
When it comes to online payments, one very impressive option is PayPal,
now part of the eBay empire. PayPal takes a slightly different approach to
online payments, and it’s worth a good look. With PayPal, you can accept
credit card payments without having a merchant account, and your customers
can pay you directly from their bank accounts.
What do you have to do? Not much. Just sign up for an account at www.
paypal.com. (See Figure 15-1.) What does it cost? Nothing, unless you
actually make some sales. In that case, you pay $0.30 per transaction and
anywhere from 1.9 to 2.9 percent of the selling price on top of that. Rates can
be higher for international sales.
PayPal offers a complete payment system for you to use at no extra cost.
You can integrate its free Web tools into your site’s pages easily. Throw in a
thorough payment-reporting system — which PayPal does — and you couldn’t
ask for a better setup for a startup business — or even an established one.

Chapter 15: Checking Out Online Payment Methods

Google Checkout
Google Checkout is an exciting new opportunity for the online entrepreneur.
Part of Google’s ever-expanding variety of services, it may be the easiest way
yet to set up the most important part of your store: the part where you actually
get paid.
It’s not very different from using PayPal; you simply place a Google Checkout
button on your site. When your buyers click it, they’re taken to an order form
like the one in Figure 15-2. Except for the specific information from your store
(item, price, and so on), it’s the same form for all Google Checkout customers.
This familiarity helps to create a high degree of comfort in your buyers.
Considering the vast user base that Google brings to the fray, this is a sales
tool you can’t do without, especially considering the prices — ranging from
1.9% to 2.9% plus 30 cents for each transaction.

255

256 Part IV: Making Money
To sign up for the program, point your browser to:

Once there, sign in via your Google account. If you don’t have one, see
Chapter 14 for the details on how to get one.

Cash alternatives
E-cash. Digital wallets. Sounds cool. Nice, easy-to-understand metaphor. You
use digitally signed certificates online just as you’d use cash in the non-Net
world. But it really hasn’t worked out. There’s no standard yet, although
something called ECML — the Electronic Commerce Modeling Language —
seems to be the first fitful attempt at one.
The most telling thing, though, is that no one’s telling. What I mean is that
when you ask the folks who are trying to market e-cash exactly how many
customers they have, exactly how many merchants are using their systems,
and exactly how profitable this all is, they clam up real fast. This is not a
good sign. When people are winning, they generally like to trumpet it to the
world. But e-cash has nothing to show so far but hype and broken promises.
Phone checks currently offer a more accepted alternative. Here’s the scenario:
You print checks with other people’s account numbers on them, take them
to your bank and deposit them, and then watch the money roll in. It’s not
some kind of criminal operation, either. It’s a perfectly legitimate business
practice — as long as you have permission from your customers to do it.
The way it works is that your customers give you authorization to create a
draft on their accounts. A draft is a check. You ask your customers to give
you the information off their checks — bank name, check number, those little
bank and account numbers across the bottom, and so on — and then you
enter that information into a check-writing program. Next, you toss some
special safety paper into your printer — that’s the kind of paper checks are
printed on — print those checks, and you’ve gotten paid just as if you had
received a check in the mail.
Figure 15-3 shows a sample screen for creating a draft with Draft Creator
from www.advancemeants.com/draft. See Table 15-4, at the end of this
chapter, for more sources.
This is one of those systems you really should have in place. It has only two
drawbacks. One is that few people are familiar with this system, but that
situation is changing rapidly. The other is not a problem for you, but some of
your more savvy customers may object that they’re paying the full amount
up front (whereas with a credit card, they can repay the purchase price over
time in small amounts).

Chapter 15: Checking Out Online Payment Methods

Figure 15-3:
You can
use a paper
draft in
place of
a normal
check.

There’s one thing you just can’t beat about this payment approach: All you pay
for is the software and the paper (which you can get at any good office supply
company). You have no monthly fee, no minimum charges, no discount rate, no
nothin’ that you’ve gotta put up with when you deal with credit card companies.

Phones, faxes, and snail mail
You should always give your customers some way to purchase from you
offline. Even if you’ve got a fully secure system, plenty of people are still
uncomfortable with entering their financial information online. If you can
have someone answering the phone (at least during normal business hours),
put that phone number on the order form. If you have a fax, put your fax
number on there, too. And don’t forget to add a physical address. That way
anyone who wants to order, but fears online security gaps, can still do so in
the old, traditional ways.
If you work from your home and don’t want to give out your home address,
you can easily get an office address by renting a private mailbox for about a
buck a day at most package-shipping companies (not the big ones like UPS
that drive trucks around, but the small storefront operations, like Pak Mail or
Mail Boxes Etc., which wrap and send packages for you). Many of them will
even forward your mail to anywhere in the world. Table 15-1 gives the URLs of
several private mailbox companies.

Getting a Merchant Account
You know that old line of Groucho Marx’s? The one that went something
like, “I wouldn’t want to join any club that would have someone like me as a
member.” Well, if you’re just getting started and don’t have any kind of
business or financial track record, you may have to settle for a credit card
merchant account — giving you the ability to accept credit cards — that
doesn’t necessarily give you the best deal.
Even if you’re really good at what you do and you’re going into all this with
your eyes wide open, the odds are pretty good that a financial analyst will
classify you right alongside the starry-eyed dreamers who don’t have a
chance — unless you have a solid business plan, a proven staff, and some
serious money behind your operation. That doesn’t necessarily mean you
can’t get a merchant account; after all, some credit card companies will give
merchant accounts to businesses that they consider high-risk clients, just as
there are loan companies that will give a loan to someone with poor credit.
But it probably means you’ll end up paying more for the privilege than a
well-established firm would. Maybe lots more.
So what do you need to do to get established? And what are the pitfalls you
have to guard against?

Choosing which acquirers to sign up with
If you think that you have a good relationship with your local bank, going into
e-commerce might make you think again. Bankers are notoriously conservative.
This is a good trait, of course, in people whom you need to trust with your
money. But that conservative streak isn’t so nice when you find out that the
conservatism means that they don’t get the whole e-commerce idea.

Chapter 15: Checking Out Online Payment Methods
Even if your bank isn’t Internet-friendly, you still have tons of other places
you can turn to — although you can’t get accepted directly by MasterCard
or VISA. For those, you have to go through some kind of intermediary, called
a merchant account acquirer, along the way. Acquirers just take applications
and pass them on to the banks that set up the merchant accounts and do the
actual transaction processing. To find out whom you can talk to about getting
set up as an Internet merchant, check out these official Web sites:
✓ MasterCard: Check out http://www.mastercard.com/cgi-bin/
acqdir/merchantReg.cgi. Type the information about your company
into the form there (see Figure 15-4), and MasterCard will take care of
the rest. If you’d rather go outside the company, you can try www.
infomerchant.net/merchantaccounts/mastercard_acquirers.
html for an outside view.
✓ VISA: You can find a list of recommended companies at http://usa.
visa.com/merchants/new_acceptance/acquirer_list.html.
✓ American Express: American Express is refreshingly simple — you
apply directly to American Express. Drop in to https://home.american
express.com/homepage/merchant_ne.shtml and go at it. If you
prefer to keep everything under one roof, you can usually also sign up
with American Express through the same merchant account provider
you use for MasterCard and VISA. Or check out both approaches and
see which method gives you the best deal.
The American Express Web site is one fine example of design. It’s both
functional and attractive. Anyone can learn a lot about Web design and
structure from studying it.
In addition to the official Web sites, there are so many acquirers online that
it’ll make your head spin. Go to any good search engine and type the phrase
accept credit cards. You should get millions of results. Even allowing for duplicate
listings and bad links, that’s a lot to dig through. I’ve pared the list down a bit
for you, though. Check out Table 15-4 for some of the major acquirers.

Deciding which cards to take
So which card should you take? Or which cards? Well, the obvious answer
is this: all of them. But the obvious answer isn’t always the best. MasterCard
and VISA for sure. They’re the real biggies that almost everyone has. Beyond
that, each card that you sign up for usually adds to your expenses. Most
credit card firms charge you for the ability to accept the cards, even if you
never process a single transaction with them. American Express doesn’t.
Well, actually, American Express has two plans. With the first one, you don’t
pay American Express any monthly fee, but you do pay the company a
percentage of the take. The second plan is just the opposite — American
Express doesn’t get a cut, but you pay a flat fee every month. The choice is
up to you.

Figure 15-4:
Starting
things with
MasterCard.

If you’re dealing with the general public, American Express is mostly useful
for high-end purchases. If you’re dealing with the business market, though,
it’s another story. Zillions of businesses have corporate American Express
cards, and you can lose a significant amount of money if you can’t take
orders with these corporate cards, even for low-priced items. When it comes
to the smaller cards, such as Discover and Diner’s Club, you should probably
take them only if you’re a really big company that does millions of dollars in
sales. It’s just not worth it for a typical small business to accept Discover or
Diner’s Club. Fortunately, most customers who have those cards will also
have VISA, MasterCard, or American Express.

Signing up
After you decide which acquirers you want to sign up with, contact them and
ask for an application. From that point, the exact details vary somewhat from
one company to the next — make sure that you ask each company about the
process before you get involved so you’ll have everything ready ahead of
time — but the basic procedure goes something like this:

Chapter 15: Checking Out Online Payment Methods
✓ Fill out application forms. Tons of sheets of them. And those forms are
always too long to photocopy the whole sheet at once, so you’ll have to
keep turning them around and shooting them again to make a copy of
the whole thing. You’ll also need a magnifying glass to read some parts
of the forms. These people take fine print seriously.
Most merchant-account providers now have an online application form.
You fill it out and submit it online; then the provider mails a printed
copy to you for your signature.
When you’re getting ready to fill out the forms, don’t neglect to have the
information handy about where the credit card company should send
the money you make — your bank name, business account number, and
ABA routing code. (Ask your bank.)
Some merchant-account providers require you to open an account in a
bank of their choosing. Run, don’t walk, away from this kind of arrangement. It’s a lot easier to handle your money if it’s in your own bank.
✓ Provide copies of your business documentation. This may include a
business license, corporate papers, or a partnership agreement, licenses
to perform various services, or even copies of tax returns. Remember
that merchant accounts are issued to companies, not individuals. Even if
you’re running a one-person shop, you have to do whatever your locality
requires to be a legal business.
✓ Estimate how many credit card orders you will process each month
and how much money those orders will involve. This is rough with
a start-up business, but it’s important because the merchant account
provider will set a limit on how much you can submit for processing. If
you end up making more than you thought, you have to ask the provider’s
permission to submit more orders than you signed up for. Most people
deliberately overestimate the number of orders and the amount of
money they expect, just to avoid this problem, but that can mean you
end up paying more than you’re required.
✓ Have an on-site inspection. That’s right. Even though your business
may not have a physical location and may exist only in cyberspace, you
may have to put up with someone coming out to your house to look at
it. These folks may even take a picture of your computer as your “place
of business” for the record. This is nothing but a bit of red tape left over
from the days before e-commerce.

Watching out for fees
At the top of the list of things to watch out for are fees. Merchants pay for the
privilege of taking credit card orders, and the credit card companies have all
sorts of little ways of sticking it to you. Here’s a sampling:

261

262 Part IV: Making Money
✓ Application fee: This is pure gravy for the bank or — more likely — the
sales agents, for whom it may be the main source of income. Doublecheck whether the application fee will be refunded if you don’t get
account approval — but take the answer with a grain of salt. Get it in
writing. Better yet, stay away from companies that charge one. Plenty of
companies out there don’t charge you just for looking at your application.
✓ Setup fee for starting the account: Again, lots of companies will set you
up for nothing. Try to avoid the ones that charge you for the simple act
of becoming a customer.
✓ Monthly statement fee: This is a charge that the credit card companies
levy on you because they have to keep track of how much money they’re
making from you. You’d think they’d be glad to do this for nothing, but
that’s not the case.
✓ Percentage of each sale: This is called the discount rate.
✓ Transaction fee: Yes, you’re already paying a percentage. But the company
still wants a few more cents.
✓ Minimum monthly charge: If you don’t make enough sales for the credit
card company’s cut to meet a certain minimum amount, you have to
pay the minimum amount anyway. Hey, the company isn’t going to lose
money just because you might. American Express has a refreshing
difference — it doesn’t have a monthly minimum.
✓ Equipment charges: If you’re strictly online, you don’t need any kind of
equipment. Don’t get suckered into buying a point-of-sale system or
anything else you’re not going to use.
Leaving off equipment, because it’s unnecessary and wildly variable in cost,
Table 15-2 shows the lowest costs typically associated with these fees. A lot
of places claim to offer lower costs, but those firms must be running charities
because these are the minimums that MasterCard and VISA charge Internet
companies. (They do offer lower rates for more “stable” traditional bricks-andmortar firms, however.)

Chapter 15: Checking Out Online Payment Methods
How do you pay all this and still make a profit? The same way every other
merchant does: You raise your prices and pass the increase on to the
consumer. However, a number of factors can make it hard to figure out
exactly how much it costs you to accept credit cards. Sales that include the
CVV number (the three-digit code on the signature strip on the back of the
credit card) usually qualify for lower rates than sales that don’t include it, for
example. And if you’re in a specialty business (about 30 types of businesses
fit this category, including adult entertainment, credit repair, jewelry, and
airlines), the rate you pay will be about double the standard rate for other
types of businesses.
Some companies, of course, actually care about your business and have nice,
helpful people working for them. The best way to find out whom you’re dealing
with — before you sign up for a merchant account with any company — is
to talk to some of its current customers. You can ask the company for
references, but its employees will likely steer you only to people they know
will say nice things about the company. Think about the references on your
résumé. You don’t include the boss who thought you were a turkey or the
coworker who always tried to take the credit for your work, do you? The
credit card companies don’t want to send you to the people who are mad at
them either.
Well, it’s kind of hard to track down the clients of a company without asking
someone at the company, so why not do it the other way around? Every Web
site that takes credit cards has to be doing business with an acquirer. And
almost all sites have an e-mail link to the Webmaster. Just surf the Web and
keep leaving messages. “Who do you use? How do you like them? Have you
had any problems with them?” (That kind of thing.) Pretty soon, you’ll start
to build up a consensus about which companies are currently the best to do
business with.

Protecting against credit card fraud
The worst problem is credit card fraud. So what happens if you get a bad
order? The answer’s simple — you don’t get paid. It’s called a chargeback —
the folks who handle your account issue a debit instead of a credit, and the
amount of the bad charge is deducted from your business bank account. The
same thing happens if a customer complains to the credit card company,
saying that you didn’t fulfill your duties (say, if the customer never received
the order or the product didn’t work). And if you get too many chargebacks,
you can lose your merchant account. Worse, you can get charged big-time
fees. That’s right — more fees. Not only do you lose the money from the
sale, but also if more than 1 percent of your sales in one month come back
as chargebacks, the credit card companies jack up your discount rate, which
means your profit on future sales shrinks.

263

264 Part IV: Making Money
Even if you successfully dispute the chargeback, you still have to pay a
processing fee to cover the credit card company’s expenses in falsely accusing
you. Then comes the ultimate “insult to injury” stunt: If you keep getting lots
of chargebacks, the company charges you to review your account. And that
review can run into many thousands of dollars — MasterCard chargeback
fees can even go up to $100,000 in a single month for repeat offenders. Not
many Internet companies can afford that kind of expense.
The problem here is that Internet companies — like those that specialize
in mail order or telephone orders — have no way of ever seeing the credit
card or the person who uses it. Normal fraud-prevention wisdom (such as
watching to see whether the credit card comes out of a wallet or a pocket)
can’t work. Nor, except in rare cases where people mail in Web pages they
printed out, can Internet companies get a signature on an order form. All the
company can do is accept a credit card number. There’s no way to prove
who provided that number. That’s the nature of the Net. No doubt this will
be resolved in some manner someday, but for now, that’s the way it is. Credit
card companies have a phrase for this: high risk. That’s right: MasterCard
and VISA consider every company on the Internet to be a high risk. Well . . .
not every company. If you’re successful enough to make zillions of dollars,
they pretend that you’re not in the same boat as everyone else on the Net,
even though nothing but the amount of profit is any different. Short of that,
though, they’ve got the entire e-commerce world in their sights.
Make sure that the software you’re using to process credit cards has an
antifraud feature called address verification. Because the credit card’s issuer
knows where it sends the bill, the address on the order can be checked
against the issuer’s records. If the address isn’t the same, you may not want
to fulfill that order. Some companies, such as florists and fruit shippers,
pretty well have to handle such orders because many of their products get
ordered by one person to be sent to another person at another address. If you
decide to take a risk like that, at least have two address areas on your form.
One should be for the address to ship to, and the other one should be for the
purchaser’s home address if it’s different from the address the item’s being
shipped to. It’s not perfect protection, but it’s a step in the right direction. And
always make sure to require a signature for delivery. That way you can prove
the item reached the right address — assuming you ship a physical product,
anyway.

Building on a Business Platform
If building your whole business from scratch while designing a Web site to
boot seems like a big task, you might want to consider using an existing
business platform to build on. There are malls online just as there are in
suburbia, and they provide you with a ready stream of traffic — the same
reason stores cluster in malls in the real world. Many online malls also
provide merchant-account services (such as Yahoo! Merchant Solutions

Chapter 15: Checking Out Online Payment Methods
from Yahoo! Stores, as shown in Figure 15-5). And most of the virtual and
dedicated server providers (see Chapter 5) have some sort of shopping-cart
software available as well. If you’re looking for an all-in-one solution to your
e-commerce needs, you should check out some of the sites in Table 15-3.

Many of the malls offer complete e-commerce solutions — Web sites, merchant
services, integrated shopping carts, and so on — and have some pretty
sophisticated antifraud capabilities. In fact, they may be better options for
many small companies than going the traditional route.

Converting Currencies
Whatever you’re up to with e-commerce, your audience is global. Even if
that’s not your intent, you’re going to have potential customers who aren’t
necessarily familiar with the current value of the U.S. dollar. Is there a
solution? Oh, yeah. A really good one.
The Universal Currency Converter (UCC) from XE.com is a must-have for any
commercial site that expects to handle international business. Like most free
services, it has a banner ad built into it, but you can negotiate with XE.com to
remove it for a fee. The converter lets anyone convert any amount in any
currency to the equivalent amount in any other currency.
The basic module has only the major world currencies in it. Don’t sweat it,
though; if you need to include others, it doesn’t cost you anything. This
limitation is only for practical reasons. After all, nearly every transaction
takes place in one of the top currencies, and the more options you add, the
slower things get. Really, how often do you need to figure out how many
Seborga luiginos are equal to 800 Uzbekistan soms?

Adding the converter to your Web page
To add the converter to your Web page, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.xe.net/ucc/customize.php.
2. Read through the terms of use.
3. Fill out the required form with your URL and contact information.
Notice that the URL must be the address of the Web page on which you
will actually put the converter, not just the general URL of your domain.
4. Click the Go! button.
You need to register each page you use the converter on.
5. On the resulting page, click the Fast Track Instructions button.
Now, you’re back on the earlier page, right below the form you filled out.
Yes, it’s a roundabout way to get there, but the registration process is
legally required if you want to use the converter.

Chapter 15: Checking Out Online Payment Methods
From here, you have two options. Both of them work fine, so it’s just a
matter of how you like to do things.
6. Use one of the following methods to get the code for the converter:
• Download the compressed file for either Windows or Mac. You
then need to unzip it and load the resulting HTML page into an
editor before you can use the code.
• Click the Click Here to See the Raw HTML link and just copy the
code off your browser screen.
If you download the file, you see that the enclosed Web page, sampucc.htm, has none of the usual elements you’re used to — HTML, HEAD,
and BODY. Yet it will still load into any browser and will work just fine.
That’s because, as useful as those elements are for envisioning the
structure of your Web page, they’re not technically required under the
HTML standard. I’m not recommending that you leave them out of your
pages, and I’m sure that XE.com did it just because the purpose of that
page is only to hold the code for you to copy and paste. But it’s a decent
bit of tech trivia you can use to amaze and amuse your friends.
7. Whichever way you get your hands on the code, paste it into your
Web page and save the file.
8. Upload the page to your Web server and try it out.
Figure 15-6 shows the converter on a Web page.

Figure 15-6:
The UCC

Customizing the converter
Now, this is one fine service as is. But you can customize it, too. XE.com will
change practically anything about the currency converter for a fee, but the
company has also built plenty of options into it that you can use on your own.

267

268 Part IV: Making Money
Changing the default currencies
If you know the country from which most of your foreign customers come,
you may want to set the converter so it’s ready to convert from your customers’
currency to yours right away. Say, for example, that you’re in the United
States and you know that almost every one of your overseas customers is
from the United Kingdom. You’d probably do well to set the conversion to
default values of dollars to pounds in that case. This won’t prevent anyone
from another country from using the converter in the normal way. All it does
is set which currencies are selected at the start; visitors can still choose
other currencies if they want.
This is what you need to do to set the default currencies in the converter:
1. Go into the HTML source code and find the SELECT elements.
The one whose name attribute has a value of From is — you guessed
it — the currency to convert from. The one whose name attribute has a
value of To is the currency to convert to.
One of the OPTION elements in each has the selected attribute. In the
original version, the default From currency is the euro, and the default
To currency is the U.S. dollar.
2. To change the default, just delete the word selected from the
OPTION elements for the current currency and add it to the ones you
want to use.
Simple, ain’t it?

Setting the default amount
Now, what if you have only one product, or what if all your products are the
same price? For example, suppose you have a price of USD $49.95 that most
people will want to convert to some other currency. Having already set the
From currency to U.S. dollars, you can now set the default amount to 49.95.
This default makes it really easy on your customers — all they have to do
is pick their native currency, and they’re off and running. To set the default
amount, look for the following code line near the beginning of the form:
<INPUT type=”text” name=”Amount” value=”1” SIZE=10><BR>
Just change the value of the value attribute. To set it to 49.95, change the
code to this:
<INPUT type=”text” name=”Amount” value=”49.95”
SIZE=10><BR>
Users can still change the default value to anything they want by simply
typing over it, just as they can select different currencies by selecting
something other than the default selections.

Chapter 15: Checking Out Online Payment Methods
If you want to change the order of the currency choices from alphabetical to
some other method — such as placing the most likely currencies on the top of
the list — all you have to do is to cut and paste the OPTION elements that
reflect the currency values in the listings. Remove them from their current
positions and paste them into their new positions. That’s all there is to it.
If, for some reason, you don’t want to give your users any choice in these
things, UCC accommodates your wishes through the use of hidden variables.
To do this, you add some INPUT type=“hidden” elements right after the
<FORM> tag and just before the <TABLE> tag.
To set the From currency so it can’t be changed, use the following code:
<INPUT type=”hidden” name=”From” value=”xyz”>
Replace the placeholder xyz with the three-digit code for the currency — such
as USD for U.S. dollars or GBP for United Kingdom (or Great Britain) pounds.
To set the To currency, you do the same thing, but the line reads as follows:
<INPUT type=”hidden” name=”To” value=”xyz”>
To set the value so it can’t be altered (which prevents people from using
your version of the UCC for test purposes unrelated to your site), add the
following line of code:
<INPUT type=”hidden” name=”Amount” value=”xyz”>
Replace the placeholder xyz with the amount to be converted (for example,
49.95).

Adding and deleting currencies
If you want to add more currencies, check out the Full Universal Currency
Converter at www.xe.net/ucc/full.shtml and copy and paste the
appropriate currency to your version. Just add a new OPTION element under
the To and/or From SELECT element for each new currency.
If you want to delete currencies from the listings, you need to delete the
entire line for that currency, beginning with the <OPTION> tag and ending
with the </OPTION> tag.

Customizing the results page
If you want to customize the default results page that appears after a currency
conversion calculation, as shown in Figure 15-7, you need to go a bit deeper.
Customizing the results page requires creating not only an element or an
attribute, but also a header and a footer. The header contains HTML that
specifies what is displayed before the calculation results appear, and the
code in the footer goes in after them.

269

270 Part IV: Making Money

Figure 15-7:
The UCC
results
page.

To set up the header and footer, think about your HTML code ahead of time,
as well as consider the variations that the UCC demands of you. The header
has to go right after the line with the <FORM> tag and has to include the
[HTML], [HEAD], [/HEAD], and [BODY] tags. Notice anything weird about
these? Yeah, the brackets aren’t the regular angle braces; they’re regular
brackets. This way, a Web browser that reads this code won’t get confused
by encountering two identical tags such as <HTML> in the same page. You put
these odd-looking quasi-HTML elements in as values of a hidden INPUT
element, and the UCC software reinterprets the square brackets just as
though they were angle braces when it comes time to create the results page.
So if you wanted to put in the following regular HTML code as your header . . .
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>
This is a currency converter.
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
. . . you’d add it to the line in the currency converter code, like this:
<INPUT type=”hidden” name=”Header” value=”[HTML][HEAD]
[TITLE]This is a currency converter.[/TITLE][/
HEAD][BODY]”>

Chapter 15: Checking Out Online Payment Methods
Then comes the regular output of the converter. After that comes the footer.
If you wanted to add the following HTML code to it . . .
<B>Thanks for using the converter!</B>
</BODY>
</HTML>
. . . you’d do it like this:
<INPUT type=”hidden” name=”Footer” value=”[B]Thanks for
using the converter![/B][/BODY]”>
The Shopper’s Currency Converter (www.xe.net/ecc/shoppers) provides
the same functionality as the UCC.

e all need advice from time to time. Even if you’re terribly independent,
as nearly self-sufficient as can be, there are times when you need to
turn to others for assistance. Well, here are ten Web sites where you can go
if you feel the need to ask for help. Each site has its own special feel and
particular set of standards. But somewhere in this chapter, you’re gonna
find a few places that you’ll be so happy to know about that you’ll just burst
with joy.

Bizy Moms
Despite its name, Bizy Moms appeals to both the mother and the father who
want to work from home while raising a family. The site hosts live chats on
issues such as “The Internet, Money, and You” or “Business on a Shoestring.”
Bizy Moms is the best place to go if you want to know about free postage,
Internet marketing, or just about anything else of interest to the work-athome parent.
Toss in the advice on time management and paperwork control from those
who’ve been there, and you’re just beginning to explore this site.

Cozahost Newsletter
The Cozahost newsletter is an e-commerce e-zine with a difference: It’s
actually worth reading, packed full of useful information written by people
who know what they’re talking about. Granted, it doesn’t have as many neat
links as are packed into this book, but against competition like that, who
stands a chance? (For the humor-impaired, that’s a joke — consider yourself
officially notified.)
Seriously, folks, the links in the Cozahost newsletter, although fewer than you
find on some sites that have a lot less to offer, are premium. It’s worth your
time to follow them. If they’re internal links, they lead to good articles on
Web work; if they’re external, they lead to decent tools that you should consider
adding to your own repertoire.

The Small Business Advisor
The Small Business Advisor is one handy little resource for those of you who
are thinking about opening your own business. This site covers everything
from taxes to insurance and has business news that actually makes sense
to small business people (and tall ones, too). Its free e-mail newsletter is a
prime source of savvy advice, useful information, and links that you’ll want to
click.
The site’s various checklists alone are worth the visit — they cover everything
from choosing a business partner or a bank to working with an attorney. Lists
of business-oriented newsgroups, Internet-specific business commentary,
and state-specific contact information are just a few of the tidbits that this
site offers.

Ten Fabulous Tools for
E-Commerce

Y

ou simply must try this blend of programs, add-ins, and services
if you’re into e-commerce. Even if you’re not, some of the items in
this chapter, such as HumanClick, MapQuest, or the Direct Marketing
Association’s Privacy Policy Generator, may come in handy. Some of these
items are freebies, some cost serious money, and others offer a combination
in which you can get a lesser version at no charge.

CafePress.com
Got some great ideas for T-shirts, coffee mugs, or mouse pads? If you don’t
want to spend lots of money for bulky and dangerous equipment, drop in to
CafePress.com. It’s not just another place that’ll iron an image onto a mouse
pad for a fee. It’s a whole e-commerce setup that costs you nothing.
You can set up a store at the site with no investment except your image files.
Just upload those files to CafePress.com, and it takes care of everything. Not
only does it do the manufacturing and shipping for you, but you don’t even
have to get a credit card merchant account; it’ll process your credit card
orders, too.

ECommerce Guide
The ECommerce Guide is an e-zine that’s a truly valuable resource for anyone
involved in e-commerce. It’s got reviews of online store software, the latest
news for e-sales, and some really, really good columns. If you’re not checking
out this site, you’re missing out on a lot of useful information.
Figure 17-4 shows the ECommerce Guide site (www.ecommerce-guide.com).

HumanClick
HumanClick is a fantastic way to add a human touch to your Web site. It’s
a service that enables you to respond instantly to your customers’ needs.
Imagine: You’re looking at a page on someone’s site, and you have some
questions about the products you see. An icon there reads Click for a Real
Person. You do so, and you go into a chat with someone who can answer
your questions. Pretty nice, eh? Yep, this one’s a must-have. Drop everything
and go to this Web site. Click the Free Trial link and think about how nice
having this feature on your site would be.
This service is definitely something you want on your Web site — and you
don’t even need to keep your people available 24 hours a day to use it.
During the times that nobody’s around to answer questions, you just tell the
HumanClick client program on your computer that you’re unavailable, and
the icon on your site changes to read Leave a Message.
As if all that’s not enough, the service places no burden on your customers
because HumanClick is JavaScript that’s embedded in your pages. It works
with every major Web browser, and your visitors don’t need to download
anything to make it work.
The HumanClick site (www.humanclick.com) is shown in Figure 17-5.

MapQuest
The MapQuest site at www.mapquest.com (shown in Figure 17-6) is well
known for helping you find your way, but MapQuest is also a fabulous place
to get maps for your site. No kidding — maps. But not just plain old road
maps. These beauties are customized maps that you can create for helping
people find your location, for example, or showing them how to get from the
hotel to a tourist attraction.

cartography services.
To access the MapQuest free services page, shown in Figure 17-7, go to

osCommerce
osCommerce has a deal that’s hard to refuse — you can download its osCommerce software for zero dollars with no limits, no time constraints, no nothing.
Using this package is a worthwhile way to get your store up and running. It
handles everything from creating product pages to managing shipping and
just about anything that you can imagine in between. It’s easy to use, too.
It’s open-source software, which means that not only is it free, but you also
get to play with the source code and change it to suit yourself. Ah, yes, that’s
the catch. If you’re not a PHP programmer or don’t have one on staff, you
may get in a bit over your head with this software; if you are, or do, however,
you can download this software.

S&H greenpoints
Ah, remember how you used to collect S&H Green Stamps? Okay, ask your
parents about it. Or maybe your grandparents. At any rate, someone you
know will remember. It used to be that you’d go to the grocery, fill your
cart, and pay for your purchases. Then, along with your change, you’d get a
certain number of stamps from the cashier, depending on how much money
you’d just spent. You’d toss the stamps in the grocery bag along with your
receipt and trot on home. You’d put the stamps in a kitchen drawer until you
had so many that you couldn’t open the drawer any more without stamps
spilling out all over the floor.
When things reached that stage, you’d have to face the odious task of licking
all the stamps and pasting them into the books that you also picked up at the
grocery. When you had a whole bunch of books filled, you’d sit down with
the S&H catalog and go on a shopping spree. Now the Internet is reviving this
grand old piece of Americana. But this time around, you don’t have to lick all
those stamps! Now, it’s S&H greenpoints, a new form of digital reward — kind
of like the Web equivalent of frequent-flyer miles.
I have a major hunch that this arrangement is going to work out well for both
online shoppers and e-merchants. If you’re into any kind of e-commerce, look
into this site.
The S&H greenpoints site (www.greenpoints.com) is shown in Figure 17-9.

SYSTRAN Translation Software
One of the hottest sites on the Web is AltaVista’s Babel Fish translation page.
It works with SYSTRAN translation software, and you can go right to the
source and set up your very own translation system. Anyone who’s serious
about e-commerce must deal with the fact that the World Wide Web is just
that — a global setup. Your storefront is an international business, and
although English is widely spoken, it’s hardly the only language in the world.
With SYSTRAN translation software working on your site, visitors quickly
translate your pages among more than half a dozen major Western languages:
Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. And
SYSTRAN doesn’t stop there. The service also includes Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, and Russian. So hurry up already and pop into SYSTRAN’s Web site.
The whole world is waiting. Run — don’t walk — to SYSTRAN’s site.

TRUSTe
Using this site is kind of an open question. What question is that? Well,
whether it’s worth the price to your organization to pay hundreds or even
thousands of dollars to an outside group to certify that your privacy policy
means what it says. To solidly quantify how much a trustmark such as the
TRUSTe seal means in terms of extra sales is impossible, just as it is with
things such as Chamber of Commerce or Better Business Bureau logos in a
store window. Nonetheless, major outfits from MSN to eBay have jumped
onto the TRUSTe bandwagon.
If you collect any kind of potentially embarrassing personal information, such
as criminal records or health status, getting TRUSTe certification is probably
worth the cost. Without it, people may be reluctant to provide honest answers
to such questions. Still, unless you’re in the employment or insurance business
(or something similar), you’re not likely to gather any kind of information other
than names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and so on.
Visit the TRUSTe site and read over all the materials there to decide for
yourself whether its service is right for your situation. You also find valuable
advice there on creating a privacy statement.
The TRUSTe site (www.truste.com) is shown in Figure 17-11.

WorldPay
When it comes to finding a financial partner for an online business, you can’t
do much better than WorldPay. Unlike so many banks, the WorldPay folks
“get it” — the Internet, that is. They truly understand that a Web business is
a global business.
Let’s face it — how many merchant account providers are comfortable dealing
with payments via both American Express and Lastschriften? How many
of them can help you comprehend payments in dollars and euros and yen?
WorldPay also supports deferred payments, allowing you to let your
customers spread their buying power over time.
On top of this, the WorldPay folks are happy to work with companies large
and small, and they have a refreshingly simple application process for merchant
accounts. So what are you waiting for?

Ten More Great Add-Ins

W

ell, you just know that every book has to have a final chapter. I’d like
to keep on going forever, but I can’t, so I’m using these last few pages
to point you toward some more great Web site add-ins and services.

@watch
If you have deep pockets and need a detailed analysis of your Web server’s
downtimes and uptimes, you may want to take a look at @watch.
@watch offers three program levels: @watch Advanced ($14.99 and up per
month), @watch Pro ($29.99 and up per month), and @watch Enterprise
($39.99 and up per month). Prices decrease if you sign up for a year at a time,
and you get volume discounts for multiple URLs.
The @watch site (www.atwatch.com) is shown in Figure 18-1.

Crossword Compiler
If you want to add a crossword puzzle as a feature on your Web page, you
need the right software — a program that understands what a Web designer
wants, not just what someone with a pencil and paper does. Crossword
Compiler is such a program. You’ll be thrilled about how easy it is to use and
the utility of its Java-enabled Web page connection. Prices range from $49 for
a single-user license all the way up to $1,900 for a multiuser package with all
the bells and whistles.

Everyone.net
You would like to offer your visitors an e-mail service, but you don’t have
much in the way of mailboxes available. You may have a handful that came
along with your Web service, but they won’t stretch very far. So you turn to
Everyone.net to save the day with their free service.
Just fill out a simple application and then eagerly count the hours until the
e-mail message with all the details arrives. In it, you will discover the wondrous
secrets of giving your users free 25MB mailboxes (not bad). Set your course
for http://www.everyone.net/private-label-email/offer-freeemail.html.
The Everyone.net site (www.everyone.net) is shown in Figure 18-3.

GeoPhrase
It is so nice when you run across some people who really understand what
the Internet is. And the first thing it is, is global. The visitor logging on to
your home page right now could be sitting anywhere from Tulsa, Oklahoma,
to Tokyo, Japan. It makes no difference to your Web server, but it probably
makes a difference to the visitor.
That’s where GeoPhrase, a technology from Geobytes, comes in. It checks
where your visitors come from and, depending on their location, offers a different greeting to them. And all you have to do is paste some HTML code into
your Web page.
And that’s just the beginning. You can customize the whole shebang, and
GeoPhase will even help you do it. Oh, did I mention that all this is free? Fire

VFM Leonardo
VFM Leonardo is a must for anyone in the travel industry. But even if your
site isn’t travel-oriented — if you just need some great content about tourist
destinations around the world — you must see this site. It’s like going on a

localendar
This calendar is one of the best add-ons you can have on your site — period.
Aside from the fact that it’s something you’re likely to want to use yourself,
localendar is an incredible facility to offer your Web site visitors. You don’t
even have to put up with hosting some banners on your calendar site — just
the little localendar link icon. And all for free!
You can set up localendar in a variety of displays such as a daily, weekly, or
monthly format, and you can set it up to blend in well with your site’s layout.
The localendar site (www.localendar.com) is shown in Figure 18-6.

Merriam-Webster Online
As you probably expect, Merriam-Webster offers dictionary and thesaurus
services, and you just know from the nature of this book that you can latch
onto those services for your own site, right? You can just go to the MerriamWebster site and fill out a simple form. Then you choose from among a
selection of search boxes and paste the code into your Web page. What

client/server: A networking system in which one computer provides resources
to other computers over a network. The main computer provides a network
service and is known as a server. Computers that use the services of a server
are clients. You also use the term server to refer to the software that provides
the service. The software that accesses the server is also known as the client
or client agent.
ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML): A proprietary Adobe markup language
that provides Web designers with the capability to easily create Web-based
database query forms and the Web pages that present their responses. See
also markup language.
colocation: Similar to leasing a dedicated server; the server is located at a
site that provides technical services to you (such as network monitoring),
but you own the server instead of leasing it. You may provide your own
equipment or purchase it from the colocation firm.
Common Gateway Interface (CGI): A program that can take information
gathered from users in a Web page form and pass that information to other
programs for processing.
compile: The source code that you create with languages, such as Java or C,
is run through a compiler that prepares a stand-alone, ready-to-run program.
configuration: The particular arrangement of practically anything having to
do with computing. Configuration, for example, may refer to how many and

cookie: A text file that a Web site places on a visitor’s computer. Cookies
typically contain information such as an identification code, the date of last
visit, visitor preferences, and so on.
copyright: The right to make copies. The creators of works such as books,

demographics: Information that you gather from visitors to your site.
Commonly, demographics include such things as the computer systems that
visitors use, their income levels, and any other information that you require
to understand your audience. Be careful about gathering data on age, race,
sex, ethnicity, religious persuasion, and such — because this may lead to
discrimination charges. Make sure that, if you do ask for this type of information,
you make clear that such disclosures are purely optional. And never, never,
never make any of this information available to anyone else, except as a
lump-sum total that doesn’t name names. You need to keep the individual
input absolutely confidential.
Denmark: A country in northern Europe, of which about 75 percent is composed

customer with your return address on it. You pay the company a wholesale
rate and keep the difference as profit.
DSL: See Digital Subscriber Line.
Dynamic HTML (DHTML): The combination of HTML along with JavaScript
and Cascading Style Sheets to create a Web page with dynamic elements. See
also JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheet.

Although some elements of e-commerce may contain traditional bricks-andmortar aspects such as mailed order forms, it takes place primarily via the
Internet or some similar network system.
e-mail: The sending and receiving of written messages via computer networks
such as the Internet.
Emerald City: The home base of the Wizard of Oz.
emoticon: A symbol used to express the emotion of the writer, such as a
smiley like :-) to indicate pleasure or harmless intent, or a wink like ;-) to
show the writer’s words are intended as a joke.
encryption: The encoding of data (such as e-mail messages or personal
information entered into online order forms) so it can’t be read by anyone
who does not have the key to the code.
end tag: See tag.
eXtensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML): A version of HTML
that follows the XML specification. See HyperText Markup Language and
eXtensible Markup Language.
eXtensible Markup Language (XML): A markup language that allows users to
create custom tags, allowing them (in effect) to create their own personalized
markup languages. See also markup language and tag.
eXtensible Style Language (XSL): A language for adding style sheets to XML
documents. The relationship between XML and XSL is the same as between
HTML and CSS. See also eXtensible Markup Language, HyperText Markup
Language, and Cascading Style Sheet.
FAQ: A listing of Frequently Asked Questions and their answers.
Fargo: A city in North Dakota.

Glossary
feed: The transmission of information from a server to either its clients or
another server.

disrupt the normal process of communication in mailing lists, newsgroups,
message boards, and chat rooms.
font: A complete set of letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters
that all have a particular look and shape. For example, this is in the Arial font,
whereas this is in the Courier New font.
frame/frameset: A method enabling you to display multiple Web pages on a
single browser screen. Framesets set off different areas of the screen. Each

GIF: An image file that follows the standards of the Graphics Interchange
Format. You commonly use GIFs for limited animation.
guillemot: A type of sea bird famous for waddling.
hardcopy: A printed version of a Web page as opposed to the electronic
version seen in a browser.
high-risk: The category into which credit card companies place businesses that
they believe are particularly prone to suffering from fraudulent transactions.
hit: A single access of a Web page.
home page: The main Web page from which all other pages in the site branch
out. It is commonly called index.html, although this is not a requirement. In
fact, any name will work — though if you use another name, visitors may see a
listing of available files instead of instantly viewing your home page. The users
then have to figure out which file among those listed is the home page.
Other common names include index.htm and default.htm. (The difference
between the .htm and .html extensions is practically nonexistent, by the
way, going back to the days when the early DOS operating system recognized
only three-letter extensions.) All modern operating systems are capable of
recognizing longer file-type extensions, and few professionals limit themselves
to the old DOS conventions anymore.

hypertext: Text on a computer that includes links to other text, images,
sound, and so on.
HyperText Markup Language (HTML): The native language of the World
Wide Web, which you use to construct Web pages.
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): System for transferring files across the
World Wide Web.
ICANN: See Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
image: General term for any picture or artwork on a Web page. Web images
are usually stored in GIF, JPEG, or PNG formats.
image map: An image that contains multiple links. Users viewing an image
map select different links by moving the mouse pointer to different parts
of the image and clicking. You must carefully design the images you use in
image maps to provide visual clues to the links that they contain.
image repository: A Web site that contains a large amount of digital art,
mostly simple icons. Image repositories typically gather these files without
paying attention to whether they’re violating copyrights and trademarks.
InterBank: An organization that processes merchant credit card transactions
for its member banks.
Internet: Short for Internetwork. The Internet consists of several different
computer networks that all link together into a network of networks.
Internet access: The capability to connect to the Internet, usually provided
by an ISP.

Glossary
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN): The
organization that accredits domain-name registrars.
Internet service provider (ISP): Company that provides Internet access,
usually by dial-up connections, although many also offer high-speed dedicated
connections.
interpret: To “translate” source code written in languages such as JavaScript
or Perl into usable instructions. A Web browser or Web server will interpret
incoming code before carrying out the instructions it contains. See also compile.
intranet: A network, usually private, consisting of several computer networks
linked together. Unlike the Internet, access to an intranet is limited to its
membership. Intranets are commonly used in B2B e-commerce situations.
IP address: The numerical equivalent of a domain name.
Isopoda: A type of crustacean with a small head.
ISP: See Internet service provider.
Java: A programming language that is often used to create applets for the
Web. See also applet.
JavaScript: A simple but powerful programming language that programmers
use to create scripts for Web pages. See also script.
JPEG: Also known as JPG. An image file that follows the standards of the
Joint Photographic Experts Group. JPEG files are generally smaller than
graphic files in other formats but maintain high-quality images nonetheless.
John of Lancaster: Admiral of the British fleet in 1422.
JPG: See JPEG.
keyword: A word or phrase that search engines use to locate Web pages
containing matching terms.
link (hyperlink): A connection between a Web page and another Internet
resource. Usually a link contains the URL (Internet address) of another Web
page, but it can also connect the user to other resources, such as images. By
convention, a link appears as blue underlined text that, after you activate
it (usually by a mouse click), causes a Web browser to load the linked
resource. You also often use images as links. An active link is one that you’re
currently clicking; a visited link is one that you activated previously.

315

316 Building a Web Site For Dummies, 4th Edition
link farm: A Web site that has no useful content of its own, but merely
contains a group of links to other sites.
list owner: The person who manages a mailing list. Usually the list owner is
the person who conceives of — and launches — the list. This person is also
known as a list manager and may be the moderator of the list as well. See also
moderator.
list server: A program that processes the e-mail messages that comprise a
mailing list. The list server usually also handles such routine administrative
matters as subscribing and unsubscribing list members if they send it a
message containing the appropriate commands.
locomotive: A specialized type of railroad car, also known as an engine, that
propels other railroad cars along the track.
log file: A file that records activity. A Web server log file, for example,
records the origin of anyone who looks at a Web page, the type of browser
the person is using, and so on. Log-file analyzer programs, such as Statbot,
are useful to Webmasters in figuring out peak times of usage, number of hits
per day, which other sites are referring visitors to this site, and so on.
mailing list: A discussion group in which the members post messages that
a list server relays to them via e-mail. Open mailing lists can be joined by
anyone; closed mailing lists require approval to join.
markup language: A computer programming language that is dedicated
to the layout and function of elements on-screen. HTML is the best-known
markup language, although there are many others for specialized purposes,
such as the Astronomical Markup Language (ASML), the Bioinformatic
Sequence Markup Language (BSML), and the Math Markup Language
(MATHML), as well as some that hope to compete with HTML to become the
new lingua franca of Web-development authors. See also eXtensible Markup
Language, eXtensible HyperText Markup Language, and HyperText
Markup Language.
marquee: A scrolling on-screen message resembling the ones that were once
common on the signs (marquees) outside theaters.
merchant account: An arrangement with a bank or a bank’s sales organization
for you to accept credit cards in payment for goods or services.
message board: Similar to a newsgroup but operates on an individual Web
site. Message boards, sometimes known as graffiti walls, enable site visitors
to leave messages for other visitors to read.

Glossary
metadata: Information beyond what is necessary for the display of a Web
page. Common uses of metadata, for example, are the inclusion of the
author’s name and a content description in the HEAD section of a Web page.
modem (modulator/demodulator): Device that enables a computer to send
signals over a telephone line.
moderator: Person who controls the content of a mailing list or newsgroup.
In extreme cases, this control can amount to censorship, but reasonable
moderation simply results in the removal of extraneous material, such as
sales pitches for products and services that don’t relate to the topic. A
moderator may also play peacemaker, attempting to keep tempers in check
among the members of the mailing list or newsgroup, thus avoiding flame
wars.
Modesty Blaise: Popular adventure character first appearing in a 1962 comic
strip and later the subject of about a dozen novels and at least one movie.
netiquette (Internet etiquette): A series of customs that enable people to get
along while living in cyberspace. Basically, you want to be nice and consider
how your actions may affect other people.
newline: A programming instruction — in the form of \n — to move the next
bit of text down one line.
Northwest Passage: Channel leading from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific
Ocean north of North America. Much sought after since the fifteenth century,
but not successfully negotiated until 1906.
online service: Sort of a mini-Internet; services such as CompuServe, America
Online, and so on provide many of the functions that the Internet does but on
a smaller scale. In recent years, the online services have lost much business
to the Internet and now provide Internet access as part of their services.
opt-in mailing list: A mailing list that you subscribe to by entering your
e-mail address in a form. You then receive a message in your mailbox asking
you to confirm the subscription. If you don’t reply to that message, your
address doesn’t go into the system. This sign-up method makes it difficult for
anyone else to sign you up for the list.
page-generation program: Software that uses a WYSIWYG (what you see is
what you get), point-and-click interface for creating Web pages.
parameter: Information that you add to the HTML code that calls a Java
applet. This information sets variable values for the applet’s use, and you
add it through the PARAM element.

317

318 Building a Web Site For Dummies, 4th Edition
password: Secret word that you use to gain computer access. Sometimes you
choose a password; sometimes someone else assigns you one. Two schools
of thought on passwords offer contradictory advice. One says to make them
so difficult to imagine that no one else can possibly guess yours in a million
years. The other school of thought says to make them easy enough that you
can remember them.
Pausanias: General of the Greek army in the Battle of Plataea in 479 B.C.
PDF: See Portable Document Format.
plug-in: A small program that provides additional functionality to a larger
program, such as letting a Web browser use Flash or adding a filter to a
graphics program.
podcast: An audio broadcast included as part of an RSS feed.
pop-up: A separate window in which a Web browser displays additional
information not found on the Web page that the visitor originally accessed.
Pop-up windows are used for a variety of purposes — some are considered
legitimate, while others often are not. Pop-up windows, in their best and
highest usage, are useful adjuncts to a normal Web page, adding helpful
information or additional capabilities. Their common usage as advertising
billboards, however, has given them a bad reputation, and programs called
pop-up blockers, which prevent all pop-up windows from materializing, are
increasingly popular. Savvy Web designers should look for ways to avoid
using pop-ups.
Portable Document Format (PDF): A proprietary document display format
developed by Adobe Systems, Inc. Although it allows people to easily transfer
existing documents into a form that’s viewable on the Web, visitors need a
separate plug-in in order to view those documents.
public domain: The group of all created works that copyright law no longer
protects (or never did).
Quimper: French city on the Odet River.
Really Simple Syndication (RSS): A method for providing a continuously
updated source of text, images, or audio. Commonly used for news stories
and blogs.
reciprocal link: A link to a Web page that also displays a link back to your
Web page. Hyperlinking is a common practice for building traffic among Web
sites. If you want to establish a reciprocal link with someone else’s site, add
a link to that site on your own, and then send an e-mail message asking the
site’s owner to reciprocate.

Glossary
registrar: A company approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN) to keep track of domain names on the Internet.
A domain name that you register must point to an active Web site. You may
also reserve or park domain names if you have no current site active for that
name but still want to prevent anybody else from registering the name. See
also Domain Name System and Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers.
RGB triplet: A method of defining on-screen colors by specifying the amount
of red, green, and blue in the color. Java applets often utilize this method.
The possible values range from 0 to 255. Thus, if you want red lettering, you
use a value of 255,0,0. This setting tells the applet to use as much red as
possible but no green and no blue.
ring: A series of Web sites that connect together through links that lead from
one to the other until visitors who follow all the links go full circle and return
to their starting place.
robot: A program, also known as a spider, that automatically surfs the Web,
indexing Web pages and adding information from those pages to a search
site’s database.
RSS: See Really Simple Syndication.
Runic alphabet: Characters that the Teutonic peoples of early Europe used;
also known as futhark.
safety paper: The kind of paper on which you print a draft or check.
script: A short program.
search engine optimization (SEO): The process of designing a Web page so it
gets the highest possible ranking among the results that a search engine puts
on-screen.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): An encryption system, originally developed by
Netscape, that allows visitors to enter information into online forms and
submit that information without allowing anyone else to read it. It’s commonly
used in processing order forms and other online forms that contain private
information.
SEO: See search engine optimization.
server: See client/server.
Server Side Includes (SSI): The capability of a server that processes a CGI
script to include data of its own that it sends back to the Web browser.

319

320 Building a Web Site For Dummies, 4th Edition
SGML: See Standard Generalized Markup Language.
shopping cart: A program that visitors to your site use to keep track of which
items they want to purchase. The shopping cart metaphor extends to the
visitor’s capability to put items into the cart and remove them before making
a final purchasing decision.
sleep: A common practice utterly unknown to authors trying to meet a
deadline.
spam: Unsolicited e-mail messages that someone sends in bulk quantities to
several addresses; also the same message posted to multiple newsgroups
simultaneously.
spider: See robot.
SSI: See Server Side Includes.
SSL: See Secure Socket Layers.
standard: Also known as specifications. Generic term for anything that a lot
of people agree on. It may apply to a way to transfer files from one system
to another, the exact structure and function of a computer language, or a
method of compressing video images. If a recognized, organized group
develops it, it’s known as an official standard. If it’s just something that the
market leader develops, and most of the people in a particular field use it, it’s
known as a de facto standard.
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML): The original markup
language from which HTML was developed. See also markup language.
start tag: See tag.
style sheets: See Cascading Style Sheet.
subscriber: A member of a mailing list. Also known, amazingly enough, as a
list member.
surfing: The act of using a Web browser to visit sites.
syndicate: A content provider that represents several different sources of
content, such as comics, opinion columns, horoscopes, and articles.

Glossary
tag: In HTML, the bracketed name of an element. You indicate the beginning
of each element in HTML by placing its name within angle brackets. This part
of the element is the start tag. You indicate the end of the element by using an
end tag, which looks just like the start tag except you add a slash before the
element’s name. The start and end tags for the TABLE element, for example,
are <TABLE> and </TABLE>.
telepathy: Ability to transfer thoughts from one mind to another.
text editor: A simple form of word processor that saves text files without
formatting.
text file: A file of text. (No kidding. No fancy formatting, either, which is why
it’s also called a plaintext file.) In transferring text files via FTP, you want to
be careful to send them as such rather than as binary files because text files
often require conversion in transferring between Windows and UNIX systems,
which use slightly different text formats. See also ASCII.
thread: Hierarchy that shows the relationship of a series of messages on a
message board. See also message board.
tiling: The repetition of a background image across a Web page until it
reaches the edge of the screen. It then begins tiling again in the next available
space below the first line of images — and so on until it fills the entire page
with multiple copies of the image.
toolbar: An add-on to a Web browser that provides additional functionality,
such as easy access to a search engine.
top-level domain (TLD): A domain that contains other domains but is not
contained itself, as designated by the final letters (such as .com or .edu) at
the end of an Internet address. You consider them top-level because you read
Internet addresses in steps from right to left, with the part after the last dot
on the right being the highest step in a hierarchy that eventually leads down,
step by dotted step, to a particular computer. The four most common TLDs
are .com, .net, .edu, and .org. These TLDs are known as the generic TLDs
or gTLDs; those that specify a country in which a site originates are known as
country-level TLDs or CLTLDs.
traffic: The number of visits to an Internet site, as in, “Our traffic increased
by 100,000 visitors last week.”

321

322 Building a Web Site For Dummies, 4th Edition
Uncertainty Principle: Fundamental theorem of quantum physics that states
that knowing both the direction of travel and the location in space-time of an
atomic particle is impossible.
uniform resource locator (URL): The address of a file (or other resource) on
the Internet. The URL for a file on a Web server is formed by putting together
a series of directions to the file, as in the following example:
http://www.someschool.edu/graphics/logo.png
Here’s a breakdown of the preceding URL:
✓ The http:// specifies the HyperText Transfer Protocol (the Web’s
native method of information exchange).
✓ The www tells you that the computer that holds the file is a Web server.
Actually, you already know that from the first part — that’s why a lot of
Web sites don’t use the www prefix anymore.
✓ The someschool segment gives the subdomain, which is what people
usually think of as the name of the Web site. The Wiley Web site, for
example, is located at www.wiley.com, and its subdomain is wiley.
✓ The three-letter extension represents the top-level domain. In this case,
the subdomain is followed by .edu, meaning that this Web site is in the
education domain.
✓ The graphics part leads to a particular directory on the specified Web
server.
✓ The final portion, logo.png, is a file within that directory.
Files located within the same server as a Web page can be referenced in a
simpler way by using relative URLs. Instead of fully specifying how to find the
file from anywhere on the Internet, relative URLs only specify how to find it
from the Web page that refers to it. The file in the preceding example could
be linked to from the school’s home page by using the following relative URL:
<IMG src=”graphics/logo.png”>
Because the Web browser that you use to view the home page already knows
where it is, it can perform a bit of cutting and pasting to come up with the
right URL. The browser “reasons” that it is currently viewing a Web page
located at http://www.someschool.edu/index.html. It strips off
everything after the final slash to arrive at http://www.someschool.edu/
and then adds graphics/logo.png to that to arrive at http://www.some
school.edu/graphics/logo.png. See also top-level domain.

Glossary
upload: To transfer a file from your computer to another computer. Also the
file that you upload. See also download.
URL: See uniform resource locator.
Van de Graaff generator: A primitive device that generates millions of volts
of static electricity.
VBScript: The Visual Basic scripting language from Microsoft. As the name
suggests, it is a version of the simple BASIC programming language, but
geared to developing Web sites rather than software in general.

separate computer and acts as a server on a network. See also dedicated
server.
visited link: See link.

Web pages.
Web ring: See ring.
Web site: Any presence on the World Wide Web. Usually applies to a
collection of Web pages.
